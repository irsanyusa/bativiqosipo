The singing competition was revamped and revived for ABC network. After 15 years on Fox, the rebirth of Idol brought back host Ryan Seacrest as well as new judges Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan. The premiere brought in 11 million viewers and continued to find the best talent across the country. Season 16 also introduced us to Cade Foehner. The singer became popular throughout the season and made it to the Top 5.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-early-beginnings>Early Beginnings</h2><p>Cade was born and raised in Shelbyville, Texas. The singer grew up singing in the church and is a devout Christian. The first time Cade performed was a part of the church’s praise and worship band. It was during his upbringing that he developed as a musician. Before Idol the singer also created the band Johnson’s Lost Crowes. The band played small shows throughout Cade’s hometown.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cade’s Road to the Top 24 on ‘American Idol’</h2><p>The singer’s audition was not televised. Cade also auditioned for The Voice Season 11 but did not advance during the Blind Auditions. Viewers were introduced to Cade during Hollywood Week when he appeared in a group of ten other contestants who sang “The Thrill Is Gone” by B.B. King. During his solo showcase Cade brought down the house as he highlighted his epic guitar skills. The singer’s rendition of “Feel It Still” by Portugal advanced him to the next round. It was Cade’s performance of “No Good” by Kaleo&nbsp;that helped push him into the Top 24 and become the season’s breakout star.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘American Idol’ Journey</h2><p>Cade brought pure rock & roll to Idol’s revamped season. He showed his range by performing songs such as “Bright Lights” by Gary Clark, Jr and “Who Will Save My Soul” by Jewel. Cade’s unique voice and energetic performances made him seem like he was already an established singer with a long career. The judges were huge fans of the contestant and often gave him a standing ovation. For one of his last performances Cade sang Idol champion Carrie Underwood’s “Undo It.” The singer made it to the Top 5 before being eliminated.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cade’s Love Story</h2><p>Although Cade did not become the Idol champion on Season 16, the singer did walk away a winner. Cade found love during his season with fellow Season 16 contestant Gabby Barrett. Gabby was a young country singer on Idol who was just as popular as Cade. She came in third place that season. The two began dating casually throughout the season and their love story was thrusted into the spotlight on the show. This was the first time contestants fell in love on the singing competition in recent memory.</p><p>Cade and Gabby’s love story was no gimmick. After their season their relationship intensified. In October 2019 the couple married. Cade and Gabby welcomed a baby girl in January 2021.</p><p>Gabby has gone on to become one of the most prominent rising stars in country music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Music Career Through Faith</h2><p>Life after Idol has been great for Cade. The singer has continued to perform to sold out shows and he is living the rockstar lifestyle that he always dreamed of. The singer continues to be vocal about his faith while posting sermons on his YouTube.</p><p>Cade’s most recent single “Southern Hallelujah” combined the singer’s love for his faith, country, and rock & roll. For now Cade seems to enjoy building his family with Gabby as she dominates <a href=#>country music</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MS-7083-1.jpeg alt="Who is the Hydra? ‘The Masked Singer’ Prediction + Clues Decoded!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>cade foehner</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2aZnKq6bq%2FAnZxmnp%2Bata%2Bx0WaYn6yVp3qiedGomqSrpJa%2Fbr%2FEmqqopl8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boyce-avenue-collective-digital-studio-1201545504.html><span>←</span><span>YouTube Rock Stars Boyce Avenue Sign with Collective Digital Studio</span></a>
