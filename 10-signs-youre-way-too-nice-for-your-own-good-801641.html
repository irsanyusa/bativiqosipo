This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the many signs that being too agreeable can be&nbsp;bad for you. You may just be&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;polite or&nbsp;avoid conflicts, but other people may not think highly of&nbsp;you for this. You can still try seeing things from everyone’s points of&nbsp;view, but also let them know what you really think.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> takes a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the hints that show how being good-natured can be&nbsp;bad for you.</p><p><h2>1. Calling staff by&nbsp;their names</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e7/64b/9c71d257ac836c73d5bf8ec529.jpg><p>Although you may just be&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;polite and attentive by&nbsp;calling service workers by&nbsp;the names that are written on&nbsp;their name tags, it&nbsp;can actually be&nbsp;<a href=#>demeaning</a>. This is&nbsp;because while their names are on&nbsp;display, yours isn’t and they are not in&nbsp;a&nbsp;position to&nbsp;ask you for your name. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, the employees are put in&nbsp;an&nbsp;inferior position. In&nbsp;some cases, you might even be&nbsp;pronouncing their names wrong, which may make things awkward.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do:</strong> Rather than putting effort into personalizing your conversation, perhaps it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;better to&nbsp;just smile and speak to&nbsp;them without mentioning any names. Some workers prefer to&nbsp;get their work done quickly without having to&nbsp;deal with small talk and keep their professional and personal lives separate.</p><p><h2>2. Showing up&nbsp;early</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/168/20a/08412e5f1d85882cf3e52fd5fa.jpg><p>You may think that making time to&nbsp;be&nbsp;early is&nbsp;showing people that you respect their time by&nbsp;not making them wait. But being <a href=#>too early</a> can sometimes be&nbsp;just as&nbsp;rude as&nbsp;being late to&nbsp;an&nbsp;event. For example, if&nbsp;you are 30&nbsp;minutes early for a&nbsp;bridal or&nbsp;baby shower but you’re not part of&nbsp;the set-up crew, the host might feel pressured to&nbsp;start entertaining when things aren’t ready yet. The same could be&nbsp;said for <a href=#>interviews</a>, where the hiring managers might think that you’re interrupting their work and that you’re over-eager or&nbsp;desperate for the job.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do:</strong> Make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule to&nbsp;never show up&nbsp;more than 15&nbsp;minutes early than the appointed time. If&nbsp;you happen to&nbsp;be&nbsp;early, just take your time somewhere else to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what you like first before appearing at&nbsp;the event.</p><p><h2>3. Falling for scams easily</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eff/e0a/4a1a965bb0a0d09819e7881d4b.jpg><p>People who are too <a href=#>trusting</a> tend to&nbsp;get taken for a&nbsp;ride more often than those who are not. If&nbsp;you’re too kind to&nbsp;be&nbsp;suspicious of&nbsp;others, you’re not likely to&nbsp;think that people might have malicious intentions toward you. Especially if&nbsp;those people have done a&nbsp;<a href=#>favor</a> for you before, because you’d feel obliged to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something for them in&nbsp;return.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do: </strong>Try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more wary of&nbsp;others, particularly people you’re not familiar with. Even with those you’re close&nbsp;to, whenever anyone asks for a&nbsp;favor, try to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;the consequences of&nbsp;you doing&nbsp;so. It’s wise to&nbsp;weigh the pros and cons of&nbsp;doing something for or&nbsp;with others.</p><p><h2>4. Saying sorry for every little thing</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b45/719/9eec3655799a244b7dfbfaf76a.jpg><p><a href=#>Apologizing</a> too much, especially for things you have little control over can make people lose respect for you or&nbsp;find you annoying. On&nbsp;top of&nbsp;that, if&nbsp;you keep saying sorry, it&nbsp;makes your future apologies sound less meaningful because it&nbsp;will seem like a&nbsp;habit rather than a&nbsp;sincere apology. Always saying sorry may even lower your self-esteem.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do:</strong> Try to&nbsp;keep tabs on&nbsp;how many times you say “I’m sorry” and know what you should and shouldn’t apologize for. If&nbsp;you find yourself saying sorry way too many times, change your apology to&nbsp;something more positive like saying, “Thank you for pointing that out to&nbsp;me,” when someone catches a&nbsp;small mistake you’ve made.</p><p><h2>5. Showering people with compliments</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/855/003/dc58905de19a481e4c60476791.jpg><p>Just like over-apologizing, if&nbsp;you give <a href=#>compliments</a> too frequently, they will soon lose their meaning. People might even think you’re trying to&nbsp;butter someone up&nbsp;to&nbsp;get something out of&nbsp;them. And if&nbsp;you keep doing&nbsp;it, people might come to&nbsp;expect compliments from you. When they don’t get complimented, they might think that something is&nbsp;wrong, or&nbsp;that you don’t like them anymore.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do: </strong>Even if&nbsp;you genuinely think highly of&nbsp;them, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;best to&nbsp;keep some of&nbsp;those thoughts to&nbsp;yourself. Remember that you are not responsible for making people feel good about themselves.</p><p><h2>6. Rebuffing compliments by&nbsp;others</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e55/9de/692fb258d0b0bd7e502a700373.jpg><p>When someone gives you a&nbsp;<a href=#>compliment</a>, you might dismiss it&nbsp;by&nbsp;saying, “Oh&nbsp;no, it’s not as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;yours!” or&nbsp;“It’s not really that great,” to&nbsp;show modesty. But doing so&nbsp;could damage your self-confidence, diminish your value in&nbsp;people’s eyes, and even harm your relationship with those who compliment you. In&nbsp;the future, they will be&nbsp;less likely to&nbsp;praise you.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do: </strong>The best way to&nbsp;accept a&nbsp;compliment is&nbsp;by&nbsp;simply saying, “Thank you.” You don’t even have to&nbsp;add anything else. Chances are, you’ll feel good for being praised and those who compliment you will feel good for praising you.</p><p><h2>7. Stuck doing things for people, even if&nbsp;you don’t want&nbsp;to</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60e/3bc/2c6b2e5f8fa29b1fc58a35a6d0.jpg><p>When you’re too nice to&nbsp;<a href=#>say “no,”</a> you’ll find yourself having less time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things for yourself and spending more time doing things for others. Worst case scenario, you might end up&nbsp;exhausted after running around doing things for everyone, all because you don’t want to&nbsp;hurt or&nbsp;disappoint people. You’d rather suffer by&nbsp;yourself than avoid conflicts.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do: </strong>Practice saying “no” in&nbsp;small, unimportant situations like making someone coffee. Remember that you can change your mind in&nbsp;most cases, not everything is&nbsp;a&nbsp;do-or-die kind of&nbsp;situation. Think about whether or&nbsp;not you are actually able to&nbsp;help someone at&nbsp;that given time. If&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;sacrifice your health over&nbsp;it, it’s probably better to&nbsp;not give them a&nbsp;hand.</p><p><h2>8. Correcting errors if&nbsp;they’re in&nbsp;your favor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a7d/be8/a7c863529a9c0906019b75042d.jpg><p>If&nbsp;the cashier gives you <a href=#>extra change</a>, even if&nbsp;it’s only a&nbsp;few cents, you return it&nbsp;because you’re being honest and think taking it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the same as&nbsp;stealing. But sometimes, it’s a&nbsp;nuisance for the staff, especially if&nbsp;they’re done settling the books for the day. Another example of&nbsp;correcting a&nbsp;mistake even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;favors you is&nbsp;when someone mistakenly thinks you hold a&nbsp;slightly higher title than you actually&nbsp;do. Even if&nbsp;they’re unlikely to&nbsp;meet you again, you feel like you’re undeserving of&nbsp;being seen to&nbsp;hold such a&nbsp;title or&nbsp;that they have the right to&nbsp;know the truth.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do: </strong>Unless you’re profiting at&nbsp;other people’s expense, it’s okay to&nbsp;let things go&nbsp;and enjoy the little mistakes that make you slightly better off than usual. You deserve good days too.</p><p><h2>9. Being politically correct all the time</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/790/56c/07dfd951cbabfcfbcd4aa4e19f.jpg><p>Being <a href=#>politically correct</a> (PC) means avoiding language and actions that insult, exclude, or&nbsp;harm people who are already experiencing discrimination. However, in&nbsp;your attempts to&nbsp;be&nbsp;respectful and sensitive, you might <a href=#>offend</a> people you want to&nbsp;protect. You trying to&nbsp;police the words to&nbsp;describe them might be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;condescending and patronizing. While others who are not in&nbsp;the group might think that you’re weak, overly sensitive, and cowardly.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do: </strong>Talk to&nbsp;the people you want to&nbsp;support to&nbsp;understand what is&nbsp;offensive and what isn’t before lending your voice to&nbsp;support them. Talk also to&nbsp;the people who think you’re censoring the truth about how their words could hurt others. Sometimes, though, you could give others the benefit of&nbsp;the doubt and let it&nbsp;go, instead of&nbsp;correcting their language. For example, when they’re in&nbsp;deep grief and unknowingly say something that could exclude a&nbsp;certain group of&nbsp;people.</p><p><h2>10. Hardly ever asking for help</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e84/e04/ea75d653d2b3aaf0b9ebb9f10f.jpg><p>You’re too nice if&nbsp;you find it&nbsp;difficult to&nbsp;ask for <a href=#>help</a> in&nbsp;times of&nbsp;need because you feel that other people have their own worries to&nbsp;take care&nbsp;of, and you don’t want to&nbsp;burden others with yours. In&nbsp;some cases, you might feel terrible about <a href=#>outing</a> someone’s behavior, for example when someone’s bullying you.</p><p><strong>What you can&nbsp;do: </strong>Keep in&nbsp;mind that people want to&nbsp;<a href=#>help</a> others, it&nbsp;gives their life meaning. If&nbsp;you give people the opportunity to&nbsp;lend you a&nbsp;hand, everyone can feel satisfied and happy in&nbsp;the end. Remember also that it’s only human to&nbsp;need help, it&nbsp;doesn’t make you a&nbsp;bad person to&nbsp;ask people to&nbsp;assist you when it’s necessary.</p><p>What other things can you add to&nbsp;this list?
