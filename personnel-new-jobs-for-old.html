S. bank, last week resigned his presidency of $577,000,000 United Light & Power Co. to become a director and officer of Dillon, Read & Co., currently the most successful Wall Street underwriting firm. When Charles McCain graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale in 1904, he entered banking in his native Arkansas, soon founded his own bank in McGehee with $1,000 capital which he ear ned in his pocket by day, hid in a sugar bar rel at night. By 1925 he was vice president of Manhattan’s National Park Bank. After it merged with Chase National, he became first president, then chairman, moving out when the Rockefellers bought control.<br>> To succeed Charles McCain, United Light & Power chose another Yaleman 61-year-old William Gordon Woolfolk, president of Michigan Consolidated Gas Co. President Woolfolk was bounced from Yale for “one last unfortunate week which, as you might say, was rather alcoholic.”<br>> Frank E. Mullen, for five years manager of Radio Corp. of America’s information department, became vice president in charge of advertising and publicity.<br>> Marvin W. Smith, manager of engineering of Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co., became a vice president.<br>> Richard (“Bobby”) Weil Jr. became president of Newark’s L. Bamberger & Co., whose $30,000,000 annual sales make it the fourth biggest U. S. department store. Slight, abrupt President Weil is a 31-year-old Yaleman, son of Minnie Straus, whose family owns both Bamberger’s and Manhattan’s big R. H. Macy & Co. Also announced last week: the retirement at 83 of Board Chairman Louis Bamberger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ub2hla4RwvMSrqqimnpq5brrEsGSjp5Koeqe70WampZxf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paramore-postpones-several-tour-dates-due-to-illness.html><span>←</span><span>Paramore Postpones Several Tour Dates Due to Illness</span></a>
