And this is&nbsp;only the small part of&nbsp;what the ’00s have presented to&nbsp;us.</p><p>We&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side</strong> got nostalgic and recalled a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;controversial things from that period, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the brightest celebrity looks, showcasing those trends.</p><p><h2>Lace-up trousers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/143/6df/d32d875752ac0e6f1122365fc8.jpg><p>Of&nbsp;course, seeing <a href=#>lace-up trousers</a> instead of&nbsp;the usual zipper today might bring up&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;questions, but a&nbsp;short while ago they were considered a&nbsp;top-notch item of&nbsp;clothing because J.Lo herself wore them. But even then, it&nbsp;was only the bravest who dared to&nbsp;buy them.</p><p><h2>Classic vest and skinny trousers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e2c/522/cca34a563e962b8a2b680ff2dc.jpg><p>Those who lived through the first decade of&nbsp;this century are well aware of&nbsp;how popular tiny classic <a href=#>vests</a> used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;during those times. They were worn with T-shirts, shirts, and even on&nbsp;naked bodies. Another controversial trend back then was skinny trousers. At&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 2000s, flared jeans were replaced by&nbsp;extremely skinny trousers. Moreover, if&nbsp;they were so&nbsp;long that there were non-aesthetically pleasing folds of&nbsp;fabric collected around the ankle area that partially covered the wearer’s shoes, these trousers could easily cause envy among your friends.</p><p><h2>Bizarre jewelry</h2></p><p><a href=#>Accessories</a> of&nbsp;the ’00s could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;topic for a&nbsp;whole separate article. Multicolored plastic beads, huge boho earrings, feathers, and rhinestones are only a&nbsp;small part of&nbsp;what we&nbsp;used to&nbsp;wear.</p><p><h2>Tutu skirt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/156/7e5/47ac6d501ebd8f1823e3594800.jpg><p>Fluffy tulle skirts became one of&nbsp;the main hits of&nbsp;those years thanks to&nbsp;the main character of&nbsp;the Sex and the City TV&nbsp;series&nbsp;— Carrie Bradshaw. <a href=#>Tutus</a> were so&nbsp;popular that even adult women couldn’t resist wearing them.</p><p><h2>Cargo trousers</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac4/d12/9fc67b5dd89bb94809c9c60d53.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seems like there is&nbsp;nothing that could look worse than low-waist cargo trousers, doesn’t it? But 10&nbsp;years ago not only did they not raise any questions, but they were also considered super-trendy. Moreover, the bravest would tuck them into boots with a&nbsp;tight-fitting bootleg.</p><p><h2>String belts</h2></p><p>Every girl owned <a href=#>a&nbsp;string belt</a> complemented by&nbsp;rivets, flower appliques, and other types of&nbsp;decorations in&nbsp;the early 2000s. Perhaps you even have one of&nbsp;these belts lying around in&nbsp;the depths of&nbsp;your wardrobe.</p><p><h2>Balloon dress</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca8/caa/9dfb415a24b3037da9c5022636.jpg><p>Luckily, the trend for dresses and skirts with a&nbsp;bottom part tucked inside itself is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer there. But a&nbsp;little while ago they were a&nbsp;hit. Even <a href=# title="Paris Hilton" data-link=tag>Paris Hilton</a>, a&nbsp;style icon of&nbsp;those times, wore them. The fact that this balloon made the body look disproportional didn’t bother fashion mongers at&nbsp;all.</p><p><h2>Wide belts</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa8/a23/1434975c3e9c14637216b8cc7a.jpg><p>Another accessory that was truly loved by&nbsp;the fashion mongers of&nbsp;those times were <a href=#>belts with a&nbsp;huge buckle</a> that were mainly a&nbsp;decorative, rather than a&nbsp;functional element.</p><p><h2>Short ankle boots</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/364/7b6/3df2cb5a55be0e6ab71f1fcf69.jpg><p>The real mess is the dress. What is going on here?</p><p>Every respectful fashion monger of&nbsp;the ’00s owned short ankle boots with high heels. Even <a href=# title="Gwyneth Paltrow" data-link=tag>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> couldn’t resist them. Not only was this type of&nbsp;footwear uncomfortable, but it&nbsp;also visually shortened the legs.</p><p><h2>Pleated miniskirt</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/787/89c/e2abd85cd8857122ae147cffd4.jpg><p><a href=#>Pleated miniskirts</a>, a-la “school girl,” were another bizarre trend of&nbsp;those times. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, they were so&nbsp;short that sometimes it&nbsp;was difficult to&nbsp;understand whether it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;skirt or&nbsp;a&nbsp;wide belt. Nevertheless, both celebrities and ordinary girls were gladly wearing them.</p><p><h2>Acid color tights</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e6e/16f/5536575b578ab09d0b37e9e710.jpg><p><a href=#>Bright tights</a> in&nbsp;various colors that were popular in&nbsp;the ’00s in&nbsp;most cases didn’t fit the overall look and lived their own life. If&nbsp;today it&nbsp;seems extremely weird, back then they could turn you into the most fashionable girl in&nbsp;the class.</p><p>What trends from those years embarrass you the most? Which ones would you gladly wear, even today?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5yecKrmLOxXam1qrrGrGStoJGpeqbCxKuwqKaVYsSwwcudZLCdkad6qrqMrZ%2BeZWJlfXG%2FjJ6tnqZdmLKtscGroK2hlah6eIWXcnByZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./yoghurt-vs-ice-cream-which-of-them-is-healthier.html><span>←</span><span>Yoghurt vs Ice-cream: Which of them is healthier?</span></a>
