It was during this group celebration that the mysterious 26th singer could be seen.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mjsbigblog</a> spotted Beckett Rex toward the back of the group. If that name doesn’t sound familiar, it’s probably because he hasn’t been featured at all during this season, likely because he dropped out of the competition.</p><p>Beckett is a 19-year-old singer from California whose father is famous British actor Malcolm McDowell. Since 2021, he has released three singles under the name Beckett. The most recent single, released in February, is called “Wildfire.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’ WINNER NOAH THOMPSON TEASES NEW MUSIC FOR FANS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjFHH5e36Fo</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-will-replace-beckett-in-the-next-round>Who Will Replace Beckett in the Next Round?</h2><p>Assuming Beckett dropped out of the competition, the show would have to replace him with another singer to bring the number back up to 26.

The first part of the Hawaii episodes will air on Sunday night.
