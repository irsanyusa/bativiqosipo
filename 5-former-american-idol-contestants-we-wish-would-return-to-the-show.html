And while we have no doubts that she’ll be killing it on season 18, we can’t help but wonder what would happen if some of our faves from past seasons were also given a chance to return.</p><p>And what’s more, we think that they could beat the competition– including Layla</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5 former “American Idol” contestants who we wish would return to the show.</h3><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Jurnee</h3><p>Jurnee has been making music since she was 7 years old, and the singer made it to the semi-finals on season 16 of American Idol. Musically, she’s got a wide range as she can effortlessly sing tunes such as “Rise Up” to uptempo numbers such as “Bang Bang.” Moreover, her overall personality makes her such a likable artist to root for. If there’s anyone who deserves a golden ticket, it’s definitely her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Anwar Robinson</h3><p>Anwar was a clear standout in the 4th season of American Idol — who can forget his performance of “September” and “What’s Going On?” He finished 7th place, and since then, he’s been busy pursuing a musical career and Anwar has even released his debut album back in 2011. With his passion for jazz and R&B, we have no doubts that this singer/songwriter can school young ‘uns on what being a soulful singer truly is, if ever he’ll be given a way to compete once more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kady Malloy</h3><p>Remember the girl from season 7 who could impersonate Britney Spears? That was Kady Malloy. She didn’t make it to the top 12, but she certainly made an impression with the judges for her unique vocals and bubbly personality. Having her back on the show would be a good move for the ABC series!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Todrick Hall</h3><p>Yeah, we know, he’s now besties with Taylor Swift and has a thriving career in the entertainment business, but hear us out. Since being eliminated from the top 16 in season 9, we always wondered if Todrick has the potential to win American Idol, if given the chance to compete again. We don’t know about you, but wouldn’t it be great if he would perform “Nails, Hair, Hips, Heels,” just once on the show?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Thia Megia</h3><p>Thia became the youngest contestant to ever join American Idol when she passed the audition at the age of 15 back in season 10. She finished at 10th place, and since then, she’s been actively performing and even went on an Asian concert tour back in 2012. The acting bug also got to her as she joined the cast of <a href=#>Days of Our Lives</a> last year. It would be wonderful to see her back on the show as a young woman and see what new things she can bring to the table.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>For now, we’ll never know if these 5 former American Idol contestants will be willing to return, but we can always dream, right?
