Tonight we will see four artists who were saved by their coaches fight for America’s vote to stay in the competition. The artists fighting for their chance to stay are Ryan Gallagher, Larriah Jackson, Taryn Papa and Julia Cooper.</strong></p><p>[SCROLL DOWN TO TAKE OUR POLL AND SUPPORT YOUR FAVORITE]</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-artists-are-going-head-to-head-in-the-knockouts-on-the-voice>4 Artists Are Going Head To Head In The Knockouts On ‘The Voice’</h2><p>These four artists are all great, so it’s definitely not going to be an easy choice for America.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-julia-cooper>Who Is Julia Cooper?</h4><p>Julia Cooper is the quirky soul and jazz singer on John Legend’s team. She will be performing “Wish You Were Gay.” She really impressed all of the coaches with her rendition of Maggie Rogers’ “Alaska”&nbsp;during her Blind Audition. She was saved by John during the Battles after she went up against powerhouse John Holiday.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-larriah-jackson>Who Is Larriah Jackson?</h4><p>Larriah Jackson is only 15 years old but when she sings, it sounds like she has been doing it for decades. She is on Gwen Stefani’s team and Gwen truly believes that Larriah can be the next pop phenomenon. Larriah will be singing “One And Only” tonight during the four-way Knockout. She was a one-chair turn during the Blind Auditions but had quite a breakthrough performance during the Battles against Carter Rubin.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE’: JOHN LEGEND AND BLAKE SHELTON CONTINUE RIVALRY DURING THE KNOCKOUTS</a></strong></p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-ryan-gallagher>Who Is Ryan Gallagher?</h4><p>Ryan Gallagher is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>an opera singer</a> on Team Kelly but she feels like he is so much more than that. Kelly said he is basically like the male Celine Dion because of his incredible lung capacity. Tonight he will be singing “Time To Say Goodbye.” He took on two Celine songs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>during the Blind Auditions</a> and the Battles so it will be refreshing to hear him take on this Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman hit.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-taryn-papa>Who Is Taryn Papa?</h4><p>Taryn Papa is a very experienced country artist that plays at Blake’s Ole Red venue in Nashville. Blake hopes that Taryn can have a career similar to Kelly’s where she has her foot in many different genres. During the Battles, Taryn held her own against country trio Worth The Wait so it will be refreshing to see her perform solo with the song “Cry.”</p><p>Want to show us who your pick is?

There are several comments with people asking others to vote for Ryan. However, Larriah could be the surprise of the night because there are also people pulling for her. While it would be a shock to see Taryn leave the competition, country voters could always pull through and show their love for her.</p><p>Also make sure you are caught up on our weekly recap show.
