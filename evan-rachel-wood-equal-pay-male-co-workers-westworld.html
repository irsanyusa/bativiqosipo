Evan Rachel Wood is finally making the same paycheck as her male co-stars on HBO’s Westworld.
In an interview with The Wrap, Wood revealed that she’ll have parity when it comes to salary for season 3 that puts her on an even playing field with counterparts like Ed Harris.
“I was just told that, you know, ‘Hey you’re, you’re getting equal pay,’” she said. And I was like [gasp]."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

I’m very lucky … It’s more about if you’re getting paid fairly, or the same, or if you’re getting paid less simply because you’re a woman, that’s not fair. There’s a lot of politics, but there’s a lot of things that are now being talked about in a different way. There is a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes. There is a lot of trying to make things equal and trying to make things fair. I don’t know, there is a lot of stuff. But this is the first time that somebody made a point of being like, ‘Hey you’re getting this. And you deserve it.’ And that was nice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuamRohHF9jp6tmqZdp66ktMSlZLCnn5l6pr3UmqNmqJGueq6ty55knKddrLyzt8SrqmavlajBuLvRpZto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./34471-dunelm-brand-sees-boost-britons-improve-their-home.html><span>←</span><span>Dunelm brand sees a boost as Britons improve their homes during lockdown</span></a>
