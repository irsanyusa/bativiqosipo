Also, if&nbsp;I cleanse very well at&nbsp;night, why would it&nbsp;be&nbsp;dirty when&nbsp;I wake&nbsp;up?”</p><p><h2>Hayek integrates movement into every mundane part of&nbsp;her day.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2aa/a87/b1a62152eba705112deb9d708a.jpg><p>Being on&nbsp;the go&nbsp;at&nbsp;all times and having a&nbsp;hectic schedule, every ordinary day is&nbsp;filled with activities galore for the Mexican-American actress. She doesn’t have much time to&nbsp;exercise, however, someone she works with in&nbsp;London taught her how to&nbsp;maximize movement and hold her body in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that every task turns into a&nbsp;workout. She is&nbsp;conscious of&nbsp;every <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>motion</a>&nbsp;— when she brushes her teeth, she holds her arms at&nbsp;shoulder height and walks up&nbsp;the stairs using her butt, not her knees.</p><p><h2>Her favorite way to&nbsp;work out is&nbsp;to&nbsp;move through something she enjoys.</h2></p><p>Although Hayek doesn’t enjoy working out, she loves <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dancing,</a> so&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>incorporates</a> it&nbsp;into her routine. Moreover, her favorite way to&nbsp;exercise is&nbsp;by&nbsp;walking her dogs&nbsp;— and she calls them her trainers.</p><p><h2>Hayek doesn’t dye her hair.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e4/2cd/d29d6a5d7d9d4cdfc2476a91dc.jpg><p>Mary Evans/AF Archive/Graham Whitby Boot/East News<span>, </span>EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>Aside from letting her curly hair run <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wild</a> and free, Hayek doesn’t dye her locks and flaunts her “natural white hairs.” For one thing, she has no&nbsp;patience for&nbsp;it, and second of&nbsp;all, she says, “I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;spend what’s left of&nbsp;my&nbsp;youth pretending I’m younger and not enjoying life.”</p><p><h2>She credits her youthful-looking skin to&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple $10&nbsp;cream.</h2></p><p>She praises a&nbsp;cream with the main ingredient <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tepezcohuite</a>, which is&nbsp;popular in&nbsp;Mexico. It&nbsp;regenerates and promotes the growth of&nbsp;healthy skin, and it’s primarily used to&nbsp;treat burns. “This is&nbsp;why&nbsp;I have no&nbsp;Botox, no&nbsp;peels, no&nbsp;fillers. I&nbsp;only use my&nbsp;creams.”</p><p><h2>Hayek says, “No, not for&nbsp;me!” to&nbsp;diets.</h2></p><p>The actress is&nbsp;proud of&nbsp;her curves and confessed, “I&nbsp;don’t like to&nbsp;diet, and I’m not good at&nbsp;it.” She’s an&nbsp;avid foodie and doesn’t believe in&nbsp;restricting foods. Whenever she feels stressed, she confesses she turns to&nbsp;food for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comfort</a>. She incorporates juicing into her everyday routine to&nbsp;get back into a&nbsp;balanced diet.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;little-known practice of&nbsp;hers is&nbsp;drinking bone broth.</h2></p><p>According to&nbsp;the actress, one of&nbsp;the secrets to&nbsp;looking so&nbsp;young is&nbsp;drinking one cup of&nbsp;this miracle potion daily. She shared, “It’s full of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>collagen</a> and helps restructure the tissues of&nbsp;your skin, nails, and hair.” It&nbsp;also helped Hayek find a&nbsp;natural cure for her back <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>aches</a>.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the best way to&nbsp;stay young at&nbsp;heart?
