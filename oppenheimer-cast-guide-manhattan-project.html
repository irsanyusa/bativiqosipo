For most of its three-hour runtime, the atomic bomb epic can feel as if you’re reading a dense biography about J. Robert Oppenheimer at three times the normal speed. With so many scientist characters orbiting Oppenheimer at light speed, you’d be forgiven for feeling a little lost at times.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">To help watch “Oppenheimer” with a bit more clarity, it’s important to know the movie takes place during three time periods. One timeline is set in 1954 as the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) holds a security hearing to investigate whether or not Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a Soviet spy. The hearing prompts the film to flash back to the events of Oppenheimer’s life, from his university days to his role in creating the atomic bomb. These portions of the film, shot in color, make up the bulk of “Oppenheimer’s” three-hour runtime.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A third storyline is shot in black and white and takes place in 1959 as Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the former chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, is seeking to become U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Strauss finds himself at the center of his own U.S. Senate confirmation hearing, which threatens to expose his involvement in the events of the 1954 timeline.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Oppenheimer” creates its own kind of fission by constantly jumping between these time periods, as characters and events twist depending on the perspective. Whether you want to go into “Oppenheimer” with a bit more knowledge or you’ve just seen it and are wondering who everybody was (it can be hard to keep track given the film’s relentless pace), below is your guide to the film’s cast and the real historical figures they play.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Cillian Murphy as J.

It’s here where Oppenheimer and his team developed the first atomic bomb for World War II. The bomb was detonated on July 16, 1945 in what is referred to as the Trinity test, with Oppenheimer present during the demonstration.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For Murphy, “Oppenheimer” marks his first time leading a Nolan movie in over 20 years. The two worked together on five previous features: Three Batman films, “Inception” and “Dunkirk.” Murphy revealed last year that in prepping to play Oppenheimer he skipped over all the mechanics of what makes an atom bomb and instead focused on the man himself.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“[I prepped by doing] an awful lot of reading,” Murphy recently&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>told The Guardian</a>. “I’m interested in the man and what [inventing the atomic bomb] does to the individual. The mechanics of it, that’s not really for me — I don’t have the intellectual capability to understand them, but these contradictory characters are fascinating.”&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Emily Blunt as Katherine "Kitty" Oppenheimer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV033.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Emily Blunt stars as Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, who married J Robert Oppenheimer in 1940. Born in Germany, Kitty was a botanist and biologist whose early life was associated with the Communist party after she became the common-law wife of party member Joseph Dallet Jr. She met Oppenheimer in 1939 at the California Institute of Technology, where he was a part time physics teacher and she was assisting physicist Charles Lauritsen. They began an affair while she was still married to medical doctor Richard Stewart Harrison. Kitty left Harrison and married Oppenheimer in November 1940 after she became pregnant with their first child, Peter. The couple moved to Los Alamos in March 1943 so that Oppenheimer could work full time on his Manhattan Project duties. They had their second child there. The isolation of living in Los Alamos contributed to Kitty’s alcoholism.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Matt Damon as Leslie Groves</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV047.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Matt Damon plays Leslie Groves, who was the director of the Manhattan Project. The group’s mission was to develop the first atomic bomb during World War II. Groves had previously overseen the construction of the Pentagon while serving as an officer in the United States Army Corps of Engineers. As director of the Manhattan Project, Groves approved Los Alamos, New Mexico as one of several testing sites for the development of the atomic bomb. He personally recruited Oppenheimer to lead the charge at Los Alamos, a divisive choice at the time as Oppenheimer lacked a Nobel Prize and administrative leadership experience. Groves was on site for the detonation of the first atomic bomb on July 16, 1945.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV004-e1689880735452.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Robert Downey Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, who served two terms on the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). Strauss was the organization’s chairman during his second term. He became an enemy of Oppenheimer’s due to the AEC’s controversial hearings in April 1954 that led to Oppenheimer’s security clearance being revoked. The hearings came as a result of Strauss becoming convinced that Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy. Strauss became convinced of the fact after Oppenheimer’s claim that the Soviets were four years behind the U.S. in nuclear weapons development got challenged. Strauss eventually asked FBI director J. Edgar Hoover to run surveillance on Oppenheimer, and the organization ran a wiretapping of Oppenheimer’s phones. Illegally-obtained conversations Oppenheimer had over the phone with lawyers and more were used by Strauss to stack the hearing’s odds against Oppenheimer.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV028.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Florence Pugh stars as Jean Tatlock,&nbsp;who had a relationship with Oppenheimer before and during his marriage to Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. The two met at the University of California, Berkeley, where Tatlock was a graduate student and Oppenheimer was a physics professor. Tatlock was a member of the American Communist Party. The film shows the two first meeting at a members gathering that Oppenheimer is brought to by his brother, Frank, who also had ties to the American Community Party. Tatlock’s relationship with Oppenheimer was cited during Lewis Strauss’ AEC hearing because of her Communist ties. Tatlock died by suicide at the age of 29 after struggling with clinical depression.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV024.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ernest Lawrence, played by Josh Hartnett, was a nuclear physicist from Canton, South Dakota who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939 for his invention of the cyclotron, a particle accelerator that was the first cyclical machine of its kind. When audiences first meet Lawrence in the film, he’s in the process of building that machine at the University of California, Berkeley. It’s here where Lawrence and Oppenheimer became close friends. Lawrence is credited with recommending to Leslie Groves that Oppenheimer be named the director of the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos research site. Lawrence went on to assist the Manhattan project with uranium-isotope separation.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Casey Affleck as Boris Pash</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1421694019.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Boris Pash, played by “Manchester by the Sea” Oscar winner Casey Affleck, was a military intelligence officer in the United States Army. During World War II, Pash was tasked with investigating potential Soviet spy activity within the University of California, Berkley’s radiation laboratory. Oppenheimer was included among those interrogated by Pash, who determined that Oppenheimer was not a Soviet spy but may be connected with the Communist party given his previous relationships (see Jean Tatlock above). Pash suggested Oppenheimer be accompanied by counter-intelligence agents while on site in Los Alamos.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Rami Malek as David Hill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV039-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">David L. Hill was an associate experimental physicist at the University of Chicago’s Met Lab during the Manhattan Project. Acording to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Atomic Heritage Foundation</a>: “On December 2, 1942, he was one of the 49 scientists who witnessed the world’s first nuclear reactor to go critical.” Hill was also one of 70 scientists and workers to sign the Szilard Petition, a document written by Leo Szilard petitioning President Truman to avoid dropping the atomic bombs on Japan. In the film, Hill pops up in the 1959 timeline to disrupt Lewis Strauss’ bid for U.S. Secretary of Commerce by revealing the devious tactics Strauss used during the AEC hearing that stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV012.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Niels Bohr, played by Christopher Nolan regular Kenneth Branagh, was a physicist from Copenhagen, Denmark who won the Nobel Peace Prize in Physics in 1922 for his work on quantum theory and atomic structure. He is famous for developing the Bohr model of the atom. Whereas the U.S. had the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons, Britain had the Tube Alloys. Bohr was a member of this group and made several visits to the Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos site during the atomic bomb’s design process. He helped Oppenheimer with work on modulated neutron initiators. In the film, Bohr is one of Oppenheimer’s physicist heroes and he attends one of Bohr’s lectures in college.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Benny Safdie as Edward Teller</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Uncut Gems” and “Good Times” co-director Benny Safdie stars as Edward Teller, a theoretical physicist from Budapest who is known as the “father of the hydrogen bomb.” He was included in Oppenheimer’s 1942 summer planning seminar for the Manhattan Project at the University of California, Berkeley, and he moved to the Manahattan Project’s Los Alamos site in 1943 and joined the Theoretical Division, which was overseen by Hans Bethe (played by Gustaf Skarsgård in the movie). As part of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer tasked Teller with researching uranium hydride and the mathematics behind a nuclear weapon implosion. He was one of the few scientists on location to watch the detonation of the first atomic bomb during the Trinity test.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Gary Oldman as President Truman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1314431162.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Harry S. Truman, the 33rd president of the United States, is played in “Oppenheimer” by Oscar winner Gary Oldman, whom Nolan worked with on the “Dark Knight” trilogy. The Manhattan Project started in 1942 under Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency. Truman served as his vice president and was notoriously not told about the Manhattan Project until he became president himself. As president, Truman authorized the first and only use of nuclear weapons in war against Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The bombs were dropped on August 6 and August 9, 1945.&nbsp;In the film, Truman assures Oppenheimer that the world will only see the president as a villain of history for dropping the bombs and not their maker himself.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>David Krumholtz as Isidor Isaac Rabi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV013.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Harold & Kumar” and “The Santa Clause” actor David Krumholtz stars as Isidor Isaac Rabi, an American physicist who won the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of nuclear magnetic resonance. His work on radar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Radiation Laboratory led him to be a consultant on the Manhattan Project. Rabi was called to testify at the AEC security hearing in 1954 and strongly defended Oppenheimer. In the film, Rabi is heard passionately telling the AEC board that Oppenheimer loved and defended his country through his actions in the Manhattan Project.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Matthew Modine as Vannevar Bush</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV045.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Stranger Things” star Matthew Modine reunites with Christopher Nolan after “The Dark Knight Rises” to play Vannevar Bush in “Oppenheimer.” Bush was an American engineer who headed the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II. He helped sell the U.S. government on creating the Manhattan Project. Later during World War II, he joined the Interim Committee that advised president Harry S. Truman on nuclear weapons. Bush was present at the Trinity test and watched the detonation of the first atomic bomb.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>David Dastmalchian as William L.

Oppenheimer ultimately gets rid of the apple before Blackett can eat it.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Tony Goldwyn as Gordon Gray</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1474947808.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Tony Goldwyn goes from playing the president on ABC’s “Scandal” to starring as Gordon Gray in “Oppenheimer.” Gray was an American attorney and national security government official during Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower’s presidential administrations. He was one of the leading members on the AEC committee during the security hearing against Oppenheimer. The film implies that Gray was against Oppenheimer from the start. Convinced Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy, Gray worked with Roger Robb to ensure the outcome of the AEC hearing was not in Oppenheimer’s favor.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Tom Conti as Albert Einstein</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screen-Shot-2023-07-20-at-10.15.43-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Albert Einstein won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics and is regarded as the most influential theoretical physicist in history. He pops up throughout “Oppenheimer” as he was friendly with the title character. In real life, Einstein did not work on the Manhattan Project. However, he did join forces with colleagues such as Leó Szilárd, Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner to worn the U.S. government that Germany would win an atomic bomb race if the U.S. did not start getting plans together to create such a weapon. The group wrote a letter to President Roosevelt, which is credited with pushing the U.S. towards the creation of the Manhattan Project.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Alex Wolff as Luis Walter Alvarez</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1329588141.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Hereditary” star Alex Wolff plays Luis Walter Alvarez, who won the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on particle physics used in the hydrogen bubble chamber. He was a friend and close colleague of Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett, see above) in the research labs at the University of California, Berkeley. It’s here where Lawrence created the cyclotron, which Alvarez used to produce and study tritium. In the film, Alvarez is with Lawrence and Oppenheimer when they get the news that an atom has been split open for the first time. In real life, Alvarez traveled to Los Alamos and worked on the Manhattan Project.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Dylan Arnold as Frank Oppenheimer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/MCDOPPE_UV022.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Dylan Arnold stars as Oppenheimer’s brother, Frank. A particle physicist in his own right, Frank conducted research on behalf of the Manhattan Project and was called to Los Alamos by his brother to help prepare the layout and designs for the Trinity test. Frank is most important to Oppenheimer’s story because he was a member of the American Communist Party and invited his brother to attend party gatherings before the Manhattan Project was founded. Oppenheimer’s ties to his brother and more party members put him under scrutiny during the AEC security hearing.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Jefferson Hall as Haakon Chevalier</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1541045920.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Haakon Chevalier, played by “Game of Thrones” actor Jefferson Hall, was a French professor at the University of California, Berkeley who became friends with Oppenheimer in 1937. In the film, Oppenheimer befriends Chevalier at a Communist party. The two went on to create the university’s teachers’ union, which angered some of Oppenheimer’s scientist colleagues as the union threw benefits in support of leftist causes. Their friendship was one of the defining parts of the AEC security hearing, as Chevalier told Oppenheimer about Soviet attempts to infiltrate the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer belatedly reported the information as to protect Chevalier’s identity, which the AEC hearing committee used in favor of stripping Oppenheimer of his security clearance.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2"><h2>Matthias Schweighöfer as Werner Heisenberg</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/GettyImages-1431928065.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Matthias Schweighöfer, best known for his role in Zack Snyder’s “Army of the Dead” franchise, appears briefly as Werner Heisenberg, the German theoretical physicist who won the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics for the creation of quantum mechanics. Oppenheimer idolizes Heisenberg in the film and even has a brief visit with him before World War II begins. Heisenberg was not involved in the Manhattan Project and instead worked on Germany’s nuclear weapons program during the war. Knowing how brilliant Heisenberg was and how his genius could aid in Germany’s creation of atomic weapons is part of the reason Oppenheimer needed to move so quickly with the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos.</p></li></ul><p><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva a-font-accent-m lrv-u-text-align-center lrv-u-padding-tb-075 u-padding-t-025@tablet">Most Popular</h2></p><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-font-size-18 lrv-u-margin-b-050 lrv-u-text-align-center">Sign Up for Variety Newsletters</h2>By subscribing, I agree to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Terms of Use</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Privacy Policy</a>. // This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google <a href=#>Privacy Policy</a> and <a href=#>Terms of Service</a> apply.<p><h2 id=section-heading class="c-heading larva a-font-accent-m lrv-u-text-align-center lrv-u-padding-tb-075 u-padding-t-025@tablet a-font-secondary-bold-3xl@tablet">More From Our Brands</h2></p><p>ad</p><p>{{ result.published_at | date: "%h %d, %Y" }}</p>To help keep your account secure, please log-in again.
