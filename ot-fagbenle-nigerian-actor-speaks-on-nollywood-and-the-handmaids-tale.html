<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Nigerian actor speaks on Nollywood and &amp;quot;The Handmaid's Tale&amp;quot;</h1></header><section class=post-content><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/VtDk9kpTURBXy9lZjI0YTAxZjE1NDYzZjQzMzAxN2QzMjkwMjRmNTcwMC5wbmeQ3gABoTAC style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p><strong>John Boyega</strong>, a Nigerian-British citizen became the first black lead in one of Hollywood’s biggest franchises- "<strong>Star Wars</strong>"- in 2015.</p><p><strong>Damson Idris</strong> went from a YouTube comedian to the lead actor in John Singleton’s TV series "<strong>Snowfall</strong>".</p><p>There are <a href=# id=472dc695-d33b-503b-ba3f-ffea0e4012a4>two Nigerian actor</a> on one of the most standout TV series in America in 2017 “<strong>American Gods</strong>”. And there is <strong>OT Fagbenle</strong>, an actor in the smash hit, Hulu produced TV series “<strong>The Handmaid’s Tale</strong>”.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The TV show is about a not so far dystopian future where an autocratic government takes over and makes women second class citizens and baby factories. OT Fagbenle plays the role of <strong>Luke Bankole</strong>, the husband of the lead female character played by <strong>Elisabeth Moss</strong>.</p><p>OT Fagbenle stood out enough for Nigerians back home to notice his Yoruba surname. The actor is one of many Nigerians leading the Nigerian Invasion on US soil or in this case screens.</p><p>“I really think Nigerians are very extraordinary talented people. We have the first African Nobel laureate. We have so many ways that we are kind of front runners. We have also a large diaspora so that gives us the statistical advantage as well” Fagbemi tells <strong>Pulse</strong> in an exclusive interview.</p><p>The handsome 36-year-old Nigerian is currently back home. “I spent most of my childhood here before the age of 10 and since then I have found more reasons to come back,” he says and reveals he wants a piece of the Nollywood action.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Olatunde Olateju Olaolorun Fagbenle</strong> has serious Nigerian cred. His father is the respected <strong>Tunde Fagbenle</strong>, a columnist on <strong>Sunday Punch</strong>. His father married his mum who is English and part Irish.</p><p>OT Fagbenle went to the same school as <strong>Tiwa Savage</strong>. “From the age of 11 to 14, we used to sit next to each other at school. So it’s really wonderful watching her shine” he tells Pulse about his connection to one of Nigeria’s biggest music acts right now.</p><p>The boy who hails from Igbajo, Oyo state is also very good friends with Nigerian director <a id=e307708f-f96c-58ce-be45-17b2f4981413 href=#>DAPS</a> the man who has shot music videos for <strong>Migos</strong>, <strong>Stormzy</strong>, <strong>2 Chainz</strong> and others. So best believe that OT Fagbenle wasn't left off ‘Bad & Boujee’, the Nigerian remix.</p><p>Throughout his interview with Pulse, OT Fagbenle stresses how extraordinary Nigerians are. He speaks glowingly of Nollywood, “It’s inspiring really because you have people who are creating extraordinary pieces of work with sometimes finite resources, and really you are just seeing the quality and quantity as well increasing. I really want to be a part of that as well. I am a filmmaker as well as an actor” he states.</p><p>The “Handmaid’s Tale” actor got into acting through a process of discovery.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I played basketball and was a musician- I played the saxophone along with some other instruments. I was also acting- so I was doing lots of different things but I think I was just better acting than other things.</p><p>“I had actually committed myself to go and study Economics in university and I was very happy to do that. I was very interested in the subject. So I couldn’t act in the school play at the time so I said I would help out with lighting.</p><p>I love being part of the Theatre. So I came home that day and said to my mum ‘so look I think I want to try and go to drama school. And she said ok, go and try it’. I got into one of the best drama schools in England” narrates OT Fagbenle.</p><p>“For some people, I think they are born with a knowledge of what they want. For me, I think it was a process of discovery and also through committing through my art, my love grew” he further says.</p><p>Right now he is flying off the success of the hit TV series. Many people did not see “Handmaid’s Tale” coming but it surely left a mark. The success of the dark and weighty series is down to two things according to OT Fagbenle.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Firstly, the political climate of the world and secondly the power dynamic between men and women over the years.</p><p>“There are so many places in Handmaid’s that resonate with us right now but also the issues of inequality between men and women- these are long standing issues, millennia worth of issues and I think the book would resonate with almost any time if you opened it and had a look at it. It just so happens we live in one of those times” he further explains.</p><p>The shooting of season 2 of The Handmaid’s Tale is to commence soon but on the other side, OT Fagbenle and his brother are involved in their own television show called “<strong>MAXXX.</strong>” They are funny skits that they have been producing for Channel 4 in the UK. You can see a clip or two on YouTube.</p><p>OT Fagbenle whose favourite Nigerian food is Eba and Okra is a part of the Nigerian contingent taking over Hollywood. While at it he still has his eyes locked on his home country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8sMCMn5igmpWjuaZ5zaKenqqZlrturcKtpqtlo6WyorfSZqanZZ6kua3F1qimnWWRo7FuwMeeZKGZnpm6orXDrGStmZyafHaulrGhoWs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./electric-feel-ceo-austin-rosen-interview.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Talent Manager Behind Hitmakers Like Post Malone</span></a>
