They spent the whole night chatting and quickly fell for each other. For them, having the same outlook on life was crucial. Soon after, they started dating, which was the beginning of their lasting relationship.</p><p><h2>Their marriage was arranged.</h2></p><p>Salma Hayek and Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault got engaged in 2007 and tied the knot in 2009. The delay was due to Hayek's fear of marriage. After several failed attempts to set a date, Pinault came up with a plan.</p><p>Salma <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, "I <strong>didn‚Äôt even know I was getting married </strong>that day. They<strong> dragged </strong>me to the<strong> </strong>court. I was nervous. My MIL had already been doing the lunch.

She <strong>married him for the money</strong>.' I'm like, 'Yeah, whatever. Think what you want.'

Salma is very close to Pinault's kids from his previous marriage. Even though she wanted many children, she couldn‚Äôt have any more after having her daughter at 41.</p><p>Salma often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, "The huge <strong>blessing</strong> I‚Äôve had is that my husband has three other children. So I have four. And they are all so different."</p><p>Although Salma's marriage thankfully turned out to be great, <a href=# title="Jason Momoa" data-link=tag>Jason Momoa</a>'s startled fans. His and Lisa Bonet's 16-year relationship was seen as a perfect example of lasting love and partnership. But now, as they finalize their divorce, the <a href=#>reasons</a> behind their split reveal a mix of changing priorities, career paths, and personal dreams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLSwuMNmm6Kfl5q%2FbsDHnmSrnZGherOxwKymp2WnncZuv8ClpJplmJbGpreMoZidZZGjeqK%2B0ZqloJ2UYrqivtGimKCdXay2tbSMoZyrZZKeua21zqeYoqqVYrW2v8GapZ1laGaGeYGVaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelsea-ballerini-teases-new-chase-stokes-inspired-love-song-youll-never-know-how-much-i-needed-you.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>&amp;quot;Youll Never Know How Much I Needed You&amp;quot;</span></a>
