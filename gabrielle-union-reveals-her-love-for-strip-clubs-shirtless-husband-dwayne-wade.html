She stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live to talk about being more transparent in this book. Union said she “just went for it.” In the book, Union shares some very serious moments and also some fun moments like confessing that she liked to go to strip clubs 10 to 15 times a year pre-pandemic.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gabrille-union-became-a-regular-at-the-strip-club-before-the-pandemic>Gabrille Union Became a Regular at the Strip Club Before the Pandemic</h2><p>Union called herself a “connoisseur” of strip clubs. She would frequently go to Magic City, a famous strip club in Atlanta where they would yell her name every time she walked in. The 48-year-old actress described it as “a welcoming place.” The most she has ever dropped in a strip club in one outing is around $10,000 to $20,000.</p><p>“You don’t really think about it because of the booze and you just want to make sure all of the ladies go home with a little something,” she said.</p><p>Kimmel asked if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Union’s husband</a> Dwayne Wade accompanied her on these outings. At the beginning of their relationship, she would see some of his teammates out at the strip club. She convinced Wade to go with her early on before it became more of a solo outing for her or with her friends.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“I would see some of his teammates, but he was like ‘No I’m not going,'” she said. “I was like ‘Don’t be afraid babe, come with me.'”</p><p>Union shared that her father was hesitant when she first started dating Wade. He wanted to know his intentions right away due to her failed first marriage to Chris Howard. During their first Thanksgiving together, Wade brought his family, and Union brought some friends from the adult entertainment industry. She joked that her dad recognized some of the adult film stars.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-union-shared-her-husband-s-pledge-to-remain-shirtless-all-summer>Union Shared Her Husband’s Pledge to Remain Shirtless All Summer</h2><p>Union and Wade were married in 2014. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>couple</a> just celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary. They recently took a lush European vacation together. Kimmel pointed out that Wade was not wearing a shirt in any of the photos from the vacation.</p><p>“He was firmly committed to shirtless summer, and I was here for it,” Union said. “I don’t often chime in about his fashion choices, but I was here for this.”</p><p>Kimmel asked who fell for who first when they began dating. She swore that Wade dropped the L bomb one night when they were under the influence of alcohol. She didn’t respond. The next day, she told Wade that she loved him too. Still to this day, Wade maintains that he did not say it first.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/159283_08545.jpg alt="Hunter Metts’s Voice Sounds Angelic in Teaser for New Single" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dwayne wade</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>gabrielle union</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xpqZq6GVobmmedSnoKimXaeyt7HApapmoJWneq271Z5kn6eiYsC1vsipZJykpZfAbr%2FHoqmtpJWowG601KyZmqaUYrG4rdinnGavkZmycA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dreaming-whilst-black-cast-jessica-hynes-akemnji-ndifornyen-bbc-a24-1235655337.html><span>←</span><span>Dreaming Whilst Black: BBC, A24 &amp;amp; Big Deal Films Series Adds Jessica Hynes, Akemnji Ndif</span></a>
