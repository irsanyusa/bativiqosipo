Then you probably already know that Sunday marks 35 years to the day since legendary comedy/sci-fi author Douglas Adams published the novel based on his radio show The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, first in a trilogy of five books. Yeah, a trilogy of five — Adams was a weird dude!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Hitchhiker’s Guide follows the story of a hapless human called Arthur Dent, who is saved from Earth’s destruction by aliens with just seconds to spare by his good friend Ford Prefect. Prefect, who Dent at first believes to be human, actually turns out to be an alien working for something called the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy — sort of a combination travel guide/Wikipedia for intergalactic travelers roaming about the universe by grabbing rides on passing spacecraft.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dent and Prefect wind up on a ship stolen by President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox. Along with another human runaway and a depressed robot, the crew find themselves in a serious of perilous adventures one after the other and it’s all good fun with a great story that holds up in its own right while also poking a lot of fun at the generally very serious science-fiction genre.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Anyway. In celebration of Hitchhiker’s 35th birthday, here are 35 things you learn from reading the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy “trilogy”:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>1.</strong> If you’re ever stuck on a question, you know the answer is, of course, just “42.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>2.</strong> Forget “Keep Calm and Carry On.” The book teaches this motto: Don’t Panic, written in very friendly letters on the front of the actual Hitchhiker’s Guide.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>3.</strong> You learn to always know where your towel is, because that thing can save your neck in more ways that you can count.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>4.</strong> Dolphins are smarter than humans — but they’re still thankful for all that fish.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>5.</strong> Earth, despite its nuclear weapons, war, bacteria and so on, is really just Mostly Harmless.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>6.</strong> The secret to understanding all the universe’s languages is putting a tiny creature in your ear called a Babel Fish — and you also know that’s where the online translation service got its name.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>7.</strong> When you rock out to Radiohead’s <i>Paranoid Android, </i>you know the band was referencing Marvin, the chronically depressed robot with a brain the size of a planet — voiced by Alan Rickman in the 2005 film adaptation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>8.</strong> This killer restaurant at the end of the universe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>9.</strong> Time is an illusion — and lunchtime doubly so.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>10.</strong> The universe’s creation made a lot of people very angry and was widely considered a bad move.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>11.</strong> Anyone who can be elected President shouldn’t be trusted to do the job.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>12.</strong> If a Vogon ever, ever tries to read poetry to you, you should turn tail and run immediately.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>13.</strong> Ford Prefect isn’t just the <a href=# rel=noopener>name of a British car</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>14.</strong> You’re not the only one who could never really get the hang of Thursdays.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>15.</strong> You can understand that an alien sent to study life on Earth would think cars were the dominant life-form.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>16.</strong> But not why people spend so much of their lives wearing digital watches.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>17.</strong> When in a bar in outer space, the best thing to order is a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>18.</strong> If somebody suddenly thinks they’re a hedgehog, the best thing you can do is give them a mirror and some pictures of a hedgehog, and they’ll figure it all out soon enough.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>19.</strong> Space is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is, to be honest.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>20.</strong> Mice aren’t actually mice at all. Instead, they’re insanely hypersmart beings from another plane of existence. Also, they’re smarter than dolphins. Who are still smarter than humans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>21. </strong>That one can find tea on a spaceship. But it’s not really tea, it’s rather something almost but not entirely unlike tea. (Also, if you count the movies, there’s a tiny lightsaber that toasts bread while you slice it. Handy!)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>22.</strong> You can spend a year dead to dodge your taxes. Good tip.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>23.</strong> Sometimes your friends turn into penguins. Or sofas. It’s all a little weird.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>24.</strong> Every once in a while, it’s absolutely terrific when somebody’s trying to kill you — it means you’re on to something.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>25.</strong> The only thing that can break the speed of light is bad news.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>26.</strong> Life is like a grapefruit, and some folks have half one for breakfast.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>27.</strong> Ships can hang in the sky, but bricks can’t.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>28.</strong> That you should always, always, always stay abreast of plans posted at your local planning department in Alpha Centauri.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>29.</strong> That if you ever discover why the universe is here, it could be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>30. </strong>And that might’ve already happened.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>31.</strong> It’s possible to be your own great-great grandfather, if something goes wrong with a contraceptive and a time machine.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>32.</strong> One of the greatest sources of power in the universe is Restaurant Math. Oh waiter, check please!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>33.</strong> Anything that happens, happens.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>34. </strong>You don’t want to go to Heaven with a headache.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>35. </strong>42.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbGllhHaEjqGgrZuYnbassdGsZKCtmZmybrPApZixsV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-and-morty-season-5-episode-4-rickdependence-spray-recap-review-1235017345.html><span>←</span><span>Rick and Morty Gets Messy With Killer Space Semen in Rickdependence Spray</span></a>
