The Jack In The Box is this season’s most terrifying reveal yet. Premiering March 9 the “The Good, The Bad, and The Cuddly” season continues to build momentum. The latest reveal has already sparked fan theories across the internet.</strong></p><p>The Jack In The Box costume comes just days after The Masked Singer’s sneak peak into Season 7. The costume is sure to fall under “The Bad” category. Whoever is behind the mask will be covered in an array of colorful feathers with a purple skin-tight bodysuit. The celebrity will wear a bird-like mask with an upside down triangle on the top middle of the mask.</p><p>This is the 10th costume reveal for the upcoming season. With only weeks to go before the Season 7 premiere, promotion is kicking into high gear. Fans have already taken to the internet to put vague clues together while trying to guess the celebrities under each mask.</p><p>From giving clues about where secret contestants grew up to possible movie roles they have played, this season is shaping up to go down in reality TV competition show history. Season 7 has already made headlines when news leaked that disgraced former Trump aide, Rudy Giuliani, was behind one of the masks during an episode taping.</p><p>It is reported that judges Robin Thicke and Ken Jeong walked off the stage in protest.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/MaskedSingerFOX/status/1497270177473384455?s=20&t=HkmlJJj-EdcnJMnjZhSEYg</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-jack-in-the-box-mask>The “Jack In The Box” Mask</h2><p>Who could be behind the Jack In The Box mask? It is possible that the celebrity behind the mask is Giuliani. There is no doubt that FOX will air the controversial episode. The Masked Singer also caught backlash for having former Vice President candidate Sarah Palin on the show. The network does not mind the bad press. Giuliani’s mask character will definitely fall under “The Bad” theme.</p><p>History shows that the term Jack In The Box is something unsavory and insulting. Some also believe that the term was the name given to a swindler who cheated tradesmen by substituting empty boxes for the full ones that were expected. In religion, a Jack In The Box was the Devil. Could this be the show getting back at Giuliani’s misdeeds, without him knowing it?</p><p>Another clue that fans may miss is the upside down red triangle on the top center of the mask. That sign is often related to feminism. Perhaps a powerful <a href=#>female singer</a> is behind the mask, or a popular activist who continues to fight for women’s rights.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Queen-and-Adam-Lambert-2019-Oscar-Opening-Performance.jpeg alt="Ready to Get ‘Starstruck’?
