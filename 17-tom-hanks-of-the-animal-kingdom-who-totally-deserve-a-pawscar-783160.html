Hachi the Akita, Hachi: A&nbsp;Dog’s Tale</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/03e/a0d/e84a4d5022a83906e2a720c97e.jpg><p>Hachi: a&nbsp;Dog’s Tale is&nbsp;probably one of&nbsp;the saddest pet movies, especially since it&nbsp;is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;true story, starring Forrest the Akita and Richard Gere as&nbsp;professor Parker Wilson. The role was actually played with 3&nbsp;different Akitas, Chico, Layla, and Forrest, but the last one was the main star.</p><p><a href=#>The famous dog actor</a> was born in&nbsp;2004 and passed in&nbsp;2017 living the life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;star. Wherever he&nbsp;went, everyone loved him. Except for Hachi, Forrest also appeared in&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode of&nbsp;Animal Planet’s Dogs 101- Akita, as&nbsp;his <a href=#>owner </a><a href=#>Joey Capaldi </a><a href=#>says</a>, along with a&nbsp;cameo in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV commercial for a&nbsp;local Delaware finance company.</p><p><h2>2. Hooch the Dog, Turner &&nbsp;Hooch</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2c/b45/a1f6965c2197ae214df2f750b1.jpg><p><a href=#>Beasley the dog</a> was the Dogue de&nbsp;Bordeaux (French Mastiff) that played the role of&nbsp;Hooch in&nbsp;the 1989 movie Turner &&nbsp;Hooch starring <a href=# title="Tom Hanks" data-link=tag>Tom Hanks</a>. Beasley only starred in&nbsp;this one movie and became famous for his police-dog-drinking-beer character.</p><p>Beasley, along with 3&nbsp;other mastiffs that stunted him in&nbsp;some scenes, were so&nbsp;loved by&nbsp;the cast. As&nbsp;<a href=#>Tom Hanks says</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview when asked about Hooch: “All the dogs who played Hooch&nbsp;— all 4&nbsp;of&nbsp;them&nbsp;— went to&nbsp;dog heaven.” This fluffy <a href=# title=buddy data-link=tag>buddy</a> was born in&nbsp;1978 and died in&nbsp;1992, living a&nbsp;full life&nbsp;— since the average life expectancy of&nbsp;his breed is&nbsp;only 5&nbsp;to&nbsp;8&nbsp;years, but he&nbsp;lived to&nbsp;be&nbsp;14.</p><p><h2>3. Lion cub, The Zookeeper’s Wife</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab9/a04/c04b1f5c8cb69a9d3cfb217464.jpg><p>The movie The Zookeeper’s Wife is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;the true story of&nbsp;Antonina Zabinska and Jan Zabinski, the director of&nbsp;the Warsaw Zoo in&nbsp;Poland. The filming actually took place at&nbsp;the zoo in&nbsp;Prague. <a href=# title="Jessica Chastain" data-link=tag>Jessica Chastain</a>, who plays Antonina, the zookeeper’s wife in&nbsp;the movie, <a href=#>said that</a> she loved acting with her co-star lions and all the animals in&nbsp;the film. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview where she was asked whether she was afraid of&nbsp;them, <a href=#>she said</a>, “...if I&nbsp;were to&nbsp;ever get hurt in&nbsp;this movie, it’s because I’m doing something wrong. It’s not the animals’ fault&nbsp;— it’s my&nbsp;fault.”</p><p>Even though her favorite animal was an&nbsp;<a href=# title=elephant data-link=tag>elephant</a> named Lily, the lions were really well behaved and “It&nbsp;wasn’t that we&nbsp;were leading them, they were leading&nbsp;us,” <a href=#>she added</a>.</p><p><h2>4. Buddy, A&nbsp;Dog’s Journey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e8/ff1/b4e4d95c3986a5e26f75028f26.jpg><p>Odin, the mixed breed Great Pyrenees Mountain dog that plays Buddy in&nbsp;the movie A&nbsp;Dog’s Journey is&nbsp;more than lovable. The character was actually portrayed by&nbsp;3&nbsp;different dogs, but Odin is&nbsp;the main star. Everyone adored him on&nbsp;the set since, as&nbsp;the <a href=#>director said</a>, “Odin is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sweetheart.”</p><p>Also, as&nbsp;his trainer <a href=#>Bonnie Judds revealed</a>, in&nbsp;contrast to&nbsp;the other dogs on&nbsp;the set, Odin, despite his huge and fluffy looks wasn’t in&nbsp;it&nbsp;for the treats, but more for the cuddling “he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;almost anything for a&nbsp;big bear hug!” She also said that before filming, Odin moved-in to&nbsp;her farm in&nbsp;Vancouver for his training and he&nbsp;really loved&nbsp;it. Because of&nbsp;his size, <a href=#>Bonnie said</a>, “The scene where he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;jump off of&nbsp;Dennis’ back and catch a&nbsp;ball was done by&nbsp;Odin’s sister, who’s much smaller.”</p><p><h2>5. Joey, War Horse</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f0/921/a416b45825844ec5e9a27c938a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the film War Horse, the 4-legged leading character, Joey, was actually played <a href=#>by&nbsp;14&nbsp;different horses</a> depending on&nbsp;the age, the stage, and the scene. However, Finder, an&nbsp;11-year-old Bay Thoroughbred Gelding then, was the main horse star. <a href=# title="Steven Spielberg" data-link=tag>Steven Spielberg</a>, the director of&nbsp;War Horse, <a href=#>admitted that</a> Finder didn’t listen to&nbsp;him but that his trainer, Bobby Lovgren, was there to&nbsp;help.</p><p>He&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;racehorse but wasn’t successful and luckily he&nbsp;turned to&nbsp;acting. As&nbsp;<a href=#>a&nbsp;film veteran</a>, he&nbsp;has stared in&nbsp;movies like Legend Of&nbsp;Zorro, Did You Hear About The Morgans, Unstoppable and the American TV&nbsp;crime series CSI Miami. His most recent work was on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Netflix data-link=tag>Netflix</a>’s Walk. Ride. Rodeo.</p><p>Bobby Lovgren met Finder on&nbsp;the War Horse set and <a href=#>he&nbsp;bought him from the producers</a>. They’ve been inseparable ever since, living their life on&nbsp;Bobby’s range in&nbsp;California.</p><p><h2>6. The Monkey, Night at&nbsp;the Museum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8e/615/fb53cf50ee8e6955bb468c1089.jpg><p><a href=#>Crystal the Monkey</a> is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;well-known pet actress. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;female capuchin monkey born in&nbsp;1994 and started her acting career in&nbsp;1997 filming the movie George of&nbsp;the Jungle. Ever since, she’s made several appearances in&nbsp;Hollywood movies with her best shots being the role of&nbsp;Dexter in&nbsp;Night at&nbsp;the Museum beside <a href=# title="Robin Williams" data-link=tag>Robin Williams</a>, and that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thieving monkey in&nbsp;Hangover Part II.</p><p>Even though Crystal looks adorable, her co-star, <a href=#>Williams, didn’t seem to&nbsp;get along well</a> with her. “It&nbsp;combines the worst aspects of&nbsp;working with children and animals when you have an&nbsp;animal that looks like a&nbsp;child,” he&nbsp;said one time when the monkey peed on&nbsp;him. <a href=#>Ben Stiller once joked</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview that she should definitely be&nbsp;nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar.</p><p><h2>7. Molly the Beagle, A&nbsp;Dog’s Journey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/77b/458/eb3549531fb6d7c0cb896ffd98.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the dog characters in&nbsp;the movie A&nbsp;Dog’s Journey is&nbsp;Molly, played by&nbsp;a&nbsp;beagle named Lemy. The role was played by&nbsp;2&nbsp;beagles, but Lemy is&nbsp;the actual star. Her trainer <a href=#>Bonnie Judd reveals</a> that the most difficult scene was to&nbsp;teach her how to&nbsp;bite, when her character, Molly, needed to&nbsp;“bite” the leg of&nbsp;the film’s villain. As&nbsp;the trainer said “It’s kind of&nbsp;like a&nbsp;piñata. The more they go&nbsp;at&nbsp;it, the more they get.”</p><p>Lemy and Abby Ryder Fortson, the young actor playing Young&nbsp;CJ, became best friends during filming. Fortson said <a href=#>in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview</a> that it&nbsp;was challenging to&nbsp;work with Lemy because of&nbsp;all the funny things she did. “My&nbsp;favorite part is&nbsp;when she knocked me&nbsp;down and started licking my&nbsp;face”, the actress said.</p><p><h2>8. Jack the Parsons Russell Terrier, The Artist</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e98/2ca/f793605375a4fb876985ce61ec.jpg><p><a href=#>Uggie</a> was the cute Parsons Russell Terrier best known for his role as&nbsp;Jack in&nbsp;the silent movie The Artist for which he&nbsp;was even awarded with the <a href=#>Cannes Film Festival Palm Dog Award</a>. Since 2005, when he&nbsp;started his career, he’s starred in&nbsp;several movies like Wassup Rockers, Water for Elephants, and his last one, Holiday Road Trip.</p><p>One of&nbsp;his trainers in&nbsp;The Artist, Clifford, joked that working with him was pretty easy because the film was silent and she could call out commands while the film was rolling. His performance in&nbsp;this movie was actually so&nbsp;good that people even created a&nbsp;campaign on&nbsp;Facebook called “<a href=#>Consider Uggie</a>” where they tried to&nbsp;gain recognition for Uggie’s performance in&nbsp;contrast with Hollywood stars.</p><p>Uggie was born in&nbsp;2002 and died in&nbsp;2015. And there was even a&nbsp;memoir that was published under the title <a href=#>Uggie, My&nbsp;Story</a>.</p><p><h2>9. Lassie the Rough Collie, Lassie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/928/b26/8dfa6658d298ebb4417e87d3a3.jpg><p>Lassie is&nbsp;probably one of&nbsp;the most famous animal-roles ever. <a href=#>Pal</a>, who lived a&nbsp;full 18&nbsp;years life, was a&nbsp;male Rough Collie that trained by&nbsp;Rudd Weatherwax to&nbsp;portray the role of&nbsp;the female dog, Lassie. His first owner, Howard Peck, brought Pal to&nbsp;Rudd because of&nbsp;his continuous barking and chasing of&nbsp;motorbikes. Even though he&nbsp;<a href=# title=got data-link=tag>got</a> the barking under control, the chasing was never fixed and Howard decided to&nbsp;give Pal to&nbsp;Rudd who gave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend.</p><p>When the novel Lassie Come-Home was published, Rudd bought Pal back from his friend for $10, believing that the dog could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie star. When the movie was filmed, a&nbsp;female dog was cast, but Rudd showed up&nbsp;with Pal in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;show the producers his talent. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;river scene, when the female collie refused to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;the water, Pal stepped in&nbsp;and performed so&nbsp;exceptionally that <a href=#>the director</a> had “tears in&nbsp;his eyes” and of&nbsp;course hired him.</p><p>Everyone loved Pal and that’s perfectly portrayed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dedicated documentary on&nbsp;Lassie’s life with the title <a href=#>The Story of&nbsp;Lassie</a>, as&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode of&nbsp;the series Hollywood Biography.</p><p><h2>10. The little pig, Babe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/742/dbf/a38e1d573fb2e1fc3580d6a132.jpg><p>Looking back at&nbsp;his career, the famous actor <a href=#>James Cromwell</a> who starred in&nbsp;Babe said that, “That pig changed my&nbsp;life... and gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;career,” talking about the little pig from the movie where he&nbsp;was nominated for an&nbsp;Oscar award for Best Actor in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Supporting Role.</p><p>The thing is&nbsp;that for the role of&nbsp;Babe, <a href=#>48&nbsp;different piggies performed</a> because baby pigs grow really fast. They were all cutie pies though and the cast loved every single one of&nbsp;them!</p><p><h2>11. Benji the Dog, Benji</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d12/5f3/bc9d395c4c9bdb4599ce1332af.jpg><p><a href=#>Higgins</a> was the star of&nbsp;the famous 70s family film, Benji, where he&nbsp;played the main character. He&nbsp;lived a&nbsp;full and happy life from 1957 to&nbsp;1975 when he&nbsp;passed away the age of&nbsp;17. He&nbsp;was found in&nbsp;1960 by&nbsp;his about-to-be life partner and trainer Frank Inn in&nbsp;an&nbsp;animal shelter in&nbsp;Los Angeles.</p><p>His first role was “the dog” in&nbsp;the series <a href=#>Petticoat Junction</a>, and he&nbsp;even won a&nbsp;Patsy Award for his performance in&nbsp;1967. Inn said that Higgins was the smartest dog he&nbsp;knew, and was able to&nbsp;learn one new trick or&nbsp;routine per week. He&nbsp;even wrote a&nbsp;poem about Higgins called, “My&nbsp;Little Brown Dog” and requested to&nbsp;be&nbsp;buried with his dog’s ashes before he&nbsp;died. However, that wasn’t legally permitted.</p><p>Higgins had a&nbsp;very deep and affectionate connection with his co-star, Edgar Buchanan, in&nbsp;both the series and in&nbsp;Benji. After Higgins died, his daughter Benjean played his role as&nbsp;Benji in&nbsp;the sequel of&nbsp;the movie series, <a href=#>For the Love of&nbsp;Benji</a> in&nbsp;1977.</p><p><h2>12. Bruiser, Legally Blonde</h2></p><p><a href=#>Moonie the Chihuahua</a> was a&nbsp;very popular dog actor, best known for his role as&nbsp;Bruiser in&nbsp;the Legally Blonde movies beside <a href=# title="Reese Witherspoon" data-link=tag>Reese Witherspoon</a>, who played Elle Woods. Moonie was found as&nbsp;a&nbsp;puppy by&nbsp;Hollywood animal trainer Sue Chipperton who trained him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;star.</p><p>Aside from his role as&nbsp;Bruiser, he&nbsp;also starred in&nbsp;2&nbsp;TV series, Three Sisters and Providence, in&nbsp;several commercials, and he&nbsp;even appeared by&nbsp;Cher’s side in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the singer’s music videos. He&nbsp;was adored by&nbsp;his fans and also his co-stars everywhere he&nbsp;went.</p><p>When he&nbsp;died of&nbsp;old age, in&nbsp;March 2016, <a href=#>Reese Witherspoon posted on&nbsp;her personal Instagram</a> account about the sad news mentioning that, “He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;sweet little Chihuahua who was very loved. I&nbsp;will never forget all the days we&nbsp;spent together ... I’m sure his tail is&nbsp;wagging in&nbsp;the sky.” Moonie even accompanied her when the famous actress received her star on&nbsp;the Hollywood Walk of&nbsp;Fame in&nbsp;2010. Their friendship was forever.</p><p><h2>13. Marcel the Monkey, Friends</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bab/0f2/02d2b85119b20b55c504fac114.jpg><p>Marcel the monkey who had a&nbsp;brief role in&nbsp;the most popular show of&nbsp;the 90s, Friends, was actually a&nbsp;female monkey named Katie. Katie also starred in&nbsp;NBC’s TV&nbsp;show <i>30Rock </i>along with taking roles in&nbsp;several commercials and photoshoots.</p><p><a href=#>During an&nbsp;interview</a> on&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel, Matt LeBlanc, who played Joey in&nbsp;the show, was asked about his relationship with Marcel and he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;liked her a&nbsp;lot, “the monkey was really cool.” But David Schwimmer&nbsp;— Ross&nbsp;— wasn’t so&nbsp;fond of&nbsp;her. “Not again with the monkey,” he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;say as&nbsp;LeBlanc recalls.</p><p>The actor also remembers a&nbsp;scene when Katie suddenly disappeared into the ceiling, jumping from one light to&nbsp;another. It&nbsp;took the crew more than half an&nbsp;hour to&nbsp;bring her back by&nbsp;tricking her with mealworms, her ultimate delight.</p><p><h2>14. Jerry Lee the police dog, K-9</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d7/438/dac102522a84e1724c3c953ee8.jpg><p>Koton was a&nbsp;beloved German Shepherd and the dog that played Jerry Lee in&nbsp;the 1989 movie K-9. <a href=#>Koton was an&nbsp;actual police dog</a> who worked with the Kansas City Police Department. Unfortunately, his tragic story follows the plot of&nbsp;the movie he&nbsp;starred&nbsp;in. In&nbsp;his career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;police dog, he&nbsp;had many successes. However, he&nbsp;was shot and killed during his attempt to&nbsp;bust a&nbsp;suspect for the murder of&nbsp;a&nbsp;police officer.</p><p><a href=#>During an&nbsp;interview</a>, Jim Belushi, who played detective Michael Dooley, and Koton’s owner, said it&nbsp;was great working with him and that it&nbsp;was nice that he&nbsp;had finally gotten the chance to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;movie his son could watch.</p><p><h2>15. Lady the Dire-wolf, Game of&nbsp;Thrones</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b25/f1b/455844557dab077dff0023ceb2.jpg><p>Zunni was the adorable wolf named Lady that accompanied Sansa Stark in&nbsp;Game of&nbsp;Thrones. Zunni was a&nbsp;<a href=#>Northern Inuit</a>, a&nbsp;giant breed, with a&nbsp;life expectancy of&nbsp;about 8&nbsp;to10&nbsp;years. <a href=# title="Sophie Turner" data-link=tag>Sophie Turner</a>, the actress who played Sansa, actually adopted Zunni and made her a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;her family.</p><p>As&nbsp;she says <a href=#>in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, </a>“Growing up&nbsp;I always wanted a&nbsp;dog, but my&nbsp;parents never wanted one. We&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with my&nbsp;character’s dire wolf, Lady, on&nbsp;set.” She later reveals that, because of&nbsp;Lady’s death on&nbsp;the series, the producers wanted to&nbsp;re-home her, but her mom as&nbsp;she said “persuaded” them to&nbsp;let&nbsp;us adopt her. Unfortunately, her furry friend died a&nbsp;few years later.</p><p><h2>16. Willy the Orca, Free Willy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e0/1a9/50200359d9a75c5707c2a844f2.jpg><p><a href=#>Keiko the Orca</a> was one of&nbsp;the most well-known animal actors in&nbsp;Hollywood starring as&nbsp;Willy in&nbsp;the family movie Free Willy in&nbsp;1993. Keiko was a&nbsp;male whale, born in&nbsp;1978, but his story took a&nbsp;sad turn. He&nbsp;was first sold to&nbsp;the Icelandic aquarium in&nbsp;Hafnarfjörður, then sold to&nbsp;Marineland in&nbsp;Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada where he&nbsp;was bullied by&nbsp;the other orcas and was then sent to&nbsp;an&nbsp;amusement park in&nbsp;Mexico City.</p><p>Warner Bros scouted him and made him a&nbsp;star. In&nbsp;1995, they founded the <a href=#>Free Willy-Keiko Foundation</a> and they raised money to&nbsp;actually free Keiko into the wild. When he&nbsp;was finally released to&nbsp;the ocean in&nbsp;Iceland in&nbsp;2002&nbsp;he didn’t make it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the wild environment because he&nbsp;was not able to&nbsp;adapt and was found dead in&nbsp;Norway’s fjords, hit by&nbsp;pneumonia in&nbsp;2003. A&nbsp;documentary under the tile <a href=#>Keiko: The Untold Story</a> was later released based on&nbsp;his life.</p><p><h2>17. Daisy, John Wick</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/756/da9/758ee95a2e95aab5e0d1992564.jpg><p>Andy, who plays Daisy in&nbsp;the movie <i>John Wick Part&nbsp;I</i>, is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;male beagle and not a&nbsp;female, as&nbsp;the role he&nbsp;portrays. John Wick’s creators choose the cutest puppy in&nbsp;the world for a&nbsp;reason. As&nbsp;his trainer, Kim Krafsky <a href=#>says in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview</a>, “There’s this thing about them, they’re just cute. They’re not overly large or&nbsp;small. They’re just a&nbsp;cuddly breed with those big sad eyes.”</p><p>The trainer <a href=#>recalls</a> that the hardest part was that of&nbsp;Omer Barnea’s role, one of&nbsp;the actors who plays a&nbsp;killer in&nbsp;the movie and has to&nbsp;mistreat the dog. The actor was having such a&nbsp;hard time that, “Every time the director yelled cut, Omer just picked up&nbsp;the dog and cuddled him.” Even though he&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;puppy when he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;the film, Andy, got so&nbsp;much attention and love from fans. However, he&nbsp;hasn’t played in&nbsp;any other roles yet.</p><p>We&nbsp;hope that you enjoyed these revealing stories about our beloved Hollywood animals. Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;pet?
