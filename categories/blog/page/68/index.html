Nearly 10 years after Mad Max: Fury Road secured its spot in the canon of all-time great action movies, Australian filmmaker George Miller has returned with a prequel that transports viewers back in time in the Wasteland.
With Alyla Browne and Anya Taylor-Joy playing younger versions of Charlize Theron's character in Fury Road, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, in theaters May 24, traces Furiosa's ascension from a prisoner of the warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) to one of the fiercest road warriors serving under the tyrant Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme in Furiosa and the late Hugh Keays-Burne in Fury Road).</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jewels of the Sun: Best Romance Books</h2><time>Jun 23, 2024</time>

Steven Spielberg spoke out on video games last month at the EA Game Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California. “I think the real indicator,” he said, “will be when somebody confesses that they cried at Level 17.” Spielberg was talking about video games and art, and the increasingly less absurd question of are-they-or-aren’t-they. The mere fact that U.S.C. has a Game Innovation Lab is probably an indicator that something is afoot, but I’m here to accept Spielberg’s challenge and come clean.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>$400 Million: Why the U.S. Owed Iran in the First Place</h2><time>Jun 22, 2024</time>

It does look fishy as all get out: $400 million in assorted denominations, stacked on wooden pallets and flown to Tehran in the dead of night by the government of the United States. Hours later, five imprisoned Americans are released and board planes to freedom. If that situation—which took place in January—doesn’t look like a hostage deal, what does?
Answer: The actual hostage deal that in fact accounts for the cash payment, which President Obama said on Thursday was not a ransom.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Green Fuels Are Accelerating Shipping Decarbonization</h2><time>Jun 22, 2024</time>

Last year in Dubai, representatives from around the world came together to take stock of climate progress and reaffirm their commitments to reducing carbon emissions. One of the most ambitious targets came from a surprising sector. In a joint declaration made at COP28, five CEOs from the world’s largest shipping companies demanded an end date for building fossil fuel-only shipping vessels.
A decade ago, this kind of ambition would have still been considered a pipe dream.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Harry Styles Reportedly Spotted With An Olivia Wilde Tattoo Months After Their Split</h2><time>Jun 22, 2024</time>

It has been a striking week of progress for Ukrainian forces in a war that had appeared to be in a grinding stalemate. In a dual-axis offensive, Kyiv’s forces have suddenly conducted a near-blitzkrieg level operation in the oblast of Kharkiv, near Ukraine’s second largest city, that has resulted in retaking over 6,000 square km of territory seized by the Russians since the start of the war in February.
Most military analysts in the west were pleasantly surprised, while there has been rumblings of real discontent among even the most ardent supporters of Vladimir Putin in Moscow.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/67/>← Prev Page</a>
