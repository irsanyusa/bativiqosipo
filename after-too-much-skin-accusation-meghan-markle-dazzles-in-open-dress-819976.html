Critics argued that her choices showed a lack of cultural sensitivity, with many taking to social media to voice their concerns. The situation was further complicated by Meghan's public acknowledgment of her Nigerian heritage, a move that some viewed as an attempt to justify her fashion choices.</p><p>The <a href=#>controversy</a> highlighted the ongoing tension between Meghan’s personal style and the expectations placed on&nbsp;her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the British royal family. While some defended her right to&nbsp;dress as&nbsp;she pleases, others questioned whether her choices were appropriate for a&nbsp;royal representing the monarchy abroad.
