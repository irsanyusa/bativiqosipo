You probably recognized a familiar face in the trio, Try Guys member Keith Habersberger. He has become quite the YouTube sensation with the groups hilarious videos. His performance tonight did not disappoint.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-try-guys-member-keith-habersberger-auditions-for-agt-with-lewberger>Try Guys Member <strong>Keith Habersberger</strong> Auditions for ‘AGT’ with <strong>Lewberger</strong></h2><p>Lewberger consists of Keith, Alex Lewis, and Hughie Stone Fish. They are a comedy band based in Los Angeles and are definitely the next Lonely Island. Their performance was seriously so funny. It was such a bright spot during the episode. The trio began singing about their love for host Terry Crews.</p><p>They eventually ripped their shirts off and willed Crews onto the stage. Much to the delight of viewers everywhere, Crews was shirtless and playing the flute. Lewberger put on quite the show and waved white flags with Crews’ face on them. Crews was so happy he even took one of the flags with him backstage.</p><p>The judges were in love with this performance and seeing Crews in his element. He deserves all of the hype for being such a fun and charismatic host. The Brooklyn&nbsp;Nine-Nine actor is literally always down for anything. Howie Mandel commented that it “seems like more fun this year than we’ve ever had.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>As you can imagine, people are commenting on YouTube and on Twitter that they recognize Keith. He has been such a huge part of the YouTube community over the years. The Try Guys have over 7 million subscribers on YouTube. Lewberger has an additional 144,000 subscribers on the platform.</p><p>They previously sang on the short-lived show Bring The Funny. Their song about remembering to lock the car is totally relatable and hilarious. They perform <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">comedy shows</a> regularly so their performance on AGT has definitely been such a nice surprise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Medhat-Mamdouh-AGT-AGT-Americas-Got-Talent-Beatboxing-.jpg alt="Beatboxing Recorder Player Blows the Judges Minds on ‘America’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>terry crews</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6graBdm7%2BwuYytqbJll6rGtHnPnqmfp6KiwG7A0aKZrqyVYsGwedOeqauxXZi%2FpsPSZqanZZGisrO1wpqqZp%2BfqXq1rcuepa1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sport-world-series-superfreaks-v-superstars.html><span>←</span><span>Sport: World Series: Superfreaks v.
