This was her way of&nbsp;showing that she’d found new power and confidence in&nbsp;her beauty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a6b/494/cb845057da927366d4369f5c37.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ashley Graham</a> uses her popularity to&nbsp;promote the ideas of&nbsp;love and acceptance of&nbsp;your body. The media call her a&nbsp;body positivity icon. One could say that 34-year-old Ashley is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pioneer in&nbsp;this area because she was the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> plus-size model to&nbsp;ever appear on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;<i>Vogue</i>.</p><p>And even earlier, in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2016</a>, her photo was printed on&nbsp;the cover of&nbsp;<i>Sports Illustrated</i>. Since then, her popularity online has grown incredibly fast.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b2/ee1/6f68275075b84bdaad872d96af.jpg><p>But she didn’t become popular quickly. She had to&nbsp;walk a&nbsp;difficult path.</p><p>Graham got into the modeling business at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;12. Young Ashley went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;modeling school where she was praised but her classmates <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>humiliated</a> her, “Girls would call me ’cottage-cheese thighs’ and ’thunder thighs.’ They’d be&nbsp;like ’Wide load coming through. Beep, beep!’ I&nbsp;hated school.” But Ashley couldn’t do&nbsp;anything but tolerate&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/51f/aab/9954b550e281daf78da804a53c.jpg><p>Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>Aside from her classmates, Ashley had to&nbsp;deal with a&nbsp;toxic relationship with her father, “My&nbsp;dad was very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>critical</a> and harsh. He&nbsp;was physically there but absent emotionally. He&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I was stupid because&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;really low reading level, and&nbsp;I wasn’t good at&nbsp;math.”</p><p>Her dad was a&nbsp;“professional” at&nbsp;compliments, and his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nickname</a> for his daughter was “Duh.” But the most painful thing she heard from him was when he&nbsp;told her she needed to&nbsp;lose weight to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;model. He&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;devalued all of&nbsp;Ashley’s attempts to&nbsp;love and accept her body.</p><p>Ashley’s mother <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>helped</a> her with body acceptance. She remembers, “When I&nbsp;first started gaining weight, she walked in&nbsp;on&nbsp;me&nbsp;while&nbsp;I was rubbing my&nbsp;hip. I&nbsp;told her, with tears in&nbsp;my&nbsp;eyes, ’It just bulges out right here.’ She was like, ’Ashley, that’s just a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your hip and your butt. If&nbsp;you didn’t have that, you wouldn’t fit into this family.’ Then it&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;hit&nbsp;me. That side butt—that’s what my&nbsp;husband calls it&nbsp;now.”</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Positive</a> affirmations were a&nbsp;huge help too, “There used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;time when&nbsp;I couldn’t say ’I love you’ to&nbsp;myself in&nbsp;the mirror, so&nbsp;I began telling myself affirmations <strong>’I&nbsp;am bold, I&nbsp;am brilliant, I&nbsp;am beautiful.’</strong> I&nbsp;still say them. That’s what gets me&nbsp;out of&nbsp;bed on&nbsp;my&nbsp;hardest days.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fc/cc3/897e755e50a51472023c82c149.jpg><p>Today, Ashley wears very bold things and doesn’t hide skin imperfections. When <i>Italian Vogue</i> didn’t edit her photos, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thanked</a> them. Also, when she was working with The Cut, Graham asked the magazine’s staff to&nbsp;not retouch her photos. She also apparently told them that if&nbsp;they did do&nbsp;any editing, <strong>they should enhance her <a href=# title=cellulite data-link=tag>cellulite</a>&nbsp;— not erase&nbsp;it</strong>.</p><p>Together with brand Knix, Graham <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>developed</a> her own line of&nbsp;<a href=# title=lingerie data-link=tag>lingerie</a> for bigger sizes. Ashley decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this because it&nbsp;was hard for her size (XL) to&nbsp;find something comfortable and beautiful from other brands.</p><p>This is&nbsp;why the lingerie developed by&nbsp;Ashley is&nbsp;for women who wear bigger sizes, and the design makes it&nbsp;so&nbsp;that even a&nbsp;strap that might show is&nbsp;beautiful.</p><p>Now, Ashley and her husband Justin have 3&nbsp;children. First, they had a&nbsp;boy, and then they had twins. Fans love the model for shattering pregnancy stereotypes.</p><p>When she was pregnant, she didn’t wear shapeless dresses, her clothes were still very bold and attractive. Once she started showing, she wore a&nbsp;tight red latex dress with high heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/23c/db2/b0e886590f8a14de80704fd262.jpg><p>Also, on&nbsp;her social media, she often <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talks</a> about the things that people still don’t openly discuss. She’s talked about postpartum injuries and wearing disposable underwear.</p><p>“After all these years in&nbsp;<a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a>, I&nbsp;never could’ve guessed that disposable underwear would be&nbsp;my&nbsp;favorite piece of&nbsp;clothing, but here we&nbsp;are! No&nbsp;one talks about the recovery and healing (yes even the messy parts) that new moms go&nbsp;through. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;show you guys that it’s not all rainbows and butterflies!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d38/121/92278e5aa2a669ba78bd8f3f03.jpg><p>She once posted a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> where her stretch marks were visible. One user commented “I&nbsp;had twins but&nbsp;I did not get any stretch marks. I&nbsp;hope that does not affect your career.” The model replied, “Gosh&nbsp;— hope&nbsp;I still have a&nbsp;career with my&nbsp;stretch marks.”</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, Ashley’s husband fully supports her, <strong>“Justin says my&nbsp;stretch marks look like the tree of&nbsp;life.”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/293/346/c236815cd48a57e8ca5305309a.png><p>It&nbsp;looks like Graham doesn’t need to&nbsp;worry about work because her popularity around the world is&nbsp;growing.
