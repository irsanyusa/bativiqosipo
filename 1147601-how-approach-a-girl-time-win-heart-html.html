In many articles, you can read that you must be self-assured or become a macho-alpha-male playboy. But it is clear that it does not work in such way.</p><p class=align-left>First, accept the fact that it's normal, to be afraid of something. A person is always afraid of something new. It doesn't matter how easy it looks, the main thing is that you do this for the first time and it is ok to be afraid. We have prepared for you ten answers to the question "how to approach a girl for the first time?".</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6538abe55e9d40b6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ Wednesday motivational quotes to get you through the week</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These ten ideas will help you overcome the most difficult step in approaching a girl: walking up to her and saying hello.</p><h3>1. Give yourself a firm promise that you will approach right now</h3><p class=align-left>This is probably the most powerful remedy for fear of approach.You made a promise to yourself! If you do not approach now, it turns out that you deceived yourself. Think about it. If you make a promise to your friends and do not do it, then you are ashamed. When you realize the importance of a promise to yourself, you realize that it is very disgusting for you to break it and deceive yourself. It is better to get a refusal than to deceive yourself! Train this sense of self-responsibility.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6538abe55e9d40b6.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to woo a girl by texting</p><h3>2. Cut off the path of retreat</h3><p class=align-left>Imagine mentally that after you made a promise to approach, a huge firewall rose behind you. And slowly but surely it comes to you, forcing to go forward as soon as possible, and all you need to get rid of this wall is to say "hello" to a beautiful girl.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9dfea9942cd0a166.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>75+ maybe it's time to give up quotes for when you are done</span></p></a><h3>3. Remember the rule of three seconds</h3><p class=align-left>A very common and very effective rule. The idea is that you mentally give a promise to approach a girl, then count "three, two, one - go". After the word "go", don't think, do not do anything else, just reach your goal. A very simple rule. It comes in handy in many life situations.</p><h3>4. Do not be afraid of opinions</h3><p class=align-left>Speaking of the fear of approach, we are most afraid of the opinions of others. If you come up and talk to a girl, other people will probably think of you approvingly. When they see that you are communicating, they will have no reason to blame you.</p><h3>5. Use the power of frustration</h3><p class=align-left>You feel yourself badly if you are afraid. Use this state, tell yourself that you no longer want to feel that way. Let this frustration become determination.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7e0d17abf099c363.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>100+ being ignored quotes for when you are feeling overlooked</span></p></a><h3>6. Make a promise</h3><p class=align-left>Give a promise to your friends that you will get acquainted with the girl right before their eyes. Then, you have to either disgrace yourself before them or go talk to the girl.</p><h3>7. Make a Plan b</h3><p class=align-left>Do you feel afraid that she might say no to you? It is not a big problem. It's okay if someone does not like you. There are so many people and views, so everyone has their own taste.</p><h3>8. Plan the first phrase</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2jmdekahj49.jpg><p class=align-left>Just think in advance what you will say to her, after the word "hello". This gives confidence that you have everything under control. It's better not to use templates but to improvise. Don't try to invent anything too convincing, it's obvious when someone is trying too hard.</p><h3>9. Value any experience, even if it is negative, it is an experience</h3><p class=align-left>Understand the important point, gentlemen - people learn from their mistakes. We should realize the importance of a negative experience. Any event can become a lesson for subsequent, more skillful attempts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/60a8e66c1565c224.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to compliment a girl: 50+ ways to make a lady feel special</span></p></a><h3>10. Do not expect too much</h3><p class=align-left>The reason for fear is in expectations and betraying the importance of the approach. It's enough for you to be yourself, if you want to win the heart of a girl, then rely on yourself. Expectations and excessive preparation will make you insincere.</p><h2>How to build confidence</h2><p class=align-left>In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Sam Ayila</a>, a marriage counselor, relationship coach, and sex therapist, recommendations on how to build confidence before approaching a lady were highlighted.
