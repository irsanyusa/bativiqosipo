<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>10 Best People to Follow for Learning Spanish</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Back in the day, everyone learned Spanish the slow way: sitting in a classroom, following a teacher’s schedule. With the internet today, we have a new, dynamic way to learn Spanish quickly. First, we get to learn Spanish online with lessons at our convenience. Second, there are online resources to help us immerse ourselves in a new language.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With smartphones in our pockets, we have tons of language resources that never existed before. We’ve looked into </span><span><strong><a href=#>Spanish language podcasts</a></strong></span><span> and watching </span><span><strong><a href=#>Spanish movies</a></strong></span><span> online before, but what about social media? Do any of the major social media platforms offer Spanish learning resources? Let’s look at some of my favourite people to follow on Twitter for learning Spanish.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>The benefits of Twitter for learning Spanish</b></h2><p><span>Twitter is a </span><i><span>microblogging</span></i><span> social network. That means every post is just a few sentences long. Create a profile on your mobile phone and browse friends, strangers, and even celebrities to read what messages they post to the internet. The main benefits of Spanish language learning Twitter is:</span></p><ul><li><span>Posts are short so read as much or as little as you like</span></li><li><span>No time commitment—you can check Twitter on your phone in 1 minute</span></li><li><span>You can share Twitter messages with study group friends</span></li><li><span>You can make Twitter a part of your immersion experience</span></li><li><span>The more you read, the faster you will learn Spanish</span></li></ul><h3><b>Who you should follow on Twitter for learning Spanish&nbsp;</b></h3><p><span>Some Twitter accounts are amateur comedians, some are linguists, and others are run by professional language learning companies. With a 280 character limit, Twitter language feeds pack a real punch. I don’t like heavy grammar lessons on social media. Twitter is for light reading and quick scrolling so these recommendations are all about funny jokes, fast news, and easy-to-read posts.</span></p><h3><strong>Here are 10 entertaining Twitter feeds for beginning Spanish speakers to follow:</strong></h3><h3><b>1.
