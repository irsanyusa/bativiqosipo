Here are some things to think about when you’re shopping for all-terrain tires.</p><h3>Your use environment</h3><p>Primarily wet, icy, or dry conditions, as well as paved or mud roads, play a role in determining where you should focus your attention in finding the best all-terrain tires. The frequency with which these tires will travel on a paved road, the climate where you live, and whether this is your primary vehicle should all be considered when you start shopping.</p><h3>Performance versus longevity</h3><p>When it comes to all-terrain tires, performance and longevity do not necessarily go hand-in-hand. Prioritizing one over the other will go a long way in narrowing down your options.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Prices for all-terrain tires can vary from $100 to $400 per tire, so it’s important to establish a budget before you start shopping. Setting this limit will also weed out a decent number of options for you and narrow your pool.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-all-terrain-tires>How we selected the best all-terrain tires</h2><p>We drew on industry experts’ advice and reviewed a selection of online and traditional retailers to make our recommendations for the best all-terrain tires, with an emphasis on price, durability, and performance. All of our picks prioritize financing options and have transparent warranty and trial periods. All but one of our picks are severe weather rated.</p><h2 id=how-do-all-terrain-tires-differ-from-other-tires>How do all-terrain tires differ from other tires?</h2><p>There are few key features that distinguish all-terrain tires from other designs like snow tires and all-season tires:</p><ul><li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Unlike standard tires, all-terrain tires are designed to handle both on- and off-road terrains.</li><li><strong>Tread pattern:</strong> All-terrain tires sport larger and deeper tread blocks, designed to better grip the road or terrain in varying conditions.</li><li><strong>Sidewall construction:</strong> Sidewall construction on all-terrain tires is stronger and reinforced to resist punctures from rocks or other rubble they may encounter in off-road conditions.</li><li><strong>On-road performance:</strong> Though they can drive on paved roads, their design may not offer the same comfort or stability on road as standard tires.</li><li><strong>Tire longevity:</strong> Depending on the quality and how they are used, all-terrain tires may have shorter longevity due to the softer tread.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-read-a-tires-sidewall>How to read a tire’s sidewall</h2><p>Jim Cole, former VP of Field Operations and Reconditioning at Vroom, a used vehicle platform, provided us with this helpful guide on how to read a tire's sidewall:</p><ul readability=18><li readability=4><p><strong>Tire type and purpose:</strong> The first letter or letters on a tire sidewall indicate the type of tire, e.g. P (passenger), LT (light truck), T (temporary), and ST (special trailer).</p></li><li readability=0><p><strong>Tire width:</strong> The three-digit number following the tire type represents the tire width in millimeters.</p></li><li readability=1><p><strong>Aspect ratio:</strong> The two-digit number after the slash (/) represents the aspect ratio, which is the ratio of the tire's height to its width.</p></li><li readability=2><p><strong>Construction type:</strong> The letter following the aspect ratio indicates the tire's construction, e.g., R (radial construction) or D (diagonal construction).</p></li><li readability=0><p><strong>Wheel diameter:</strong> The two-digit number following the construction type represents the diameter of the wheel in inches.</p></li><li readability=0><p><strong>Load index:</strong> The load index is a numerical code indicating the maximum load-carrying capacity of the tire. Refer to a load index chart to find the corresponding weight capacity.</p></li><li readability=0><p><strong>Speed rating:</strong> The speed rating indicates the maximum speed the tire can handle safely. Common speed ratings include:</p><ul><li><strong>S:</strong> Up to 112 mph</li><li><strong>T:</strong> Up to 118 mph</li><li><strong>H:</strong> Up to 130 mph</li><li><strong>V:</strong> Up to 149 mph</li><li><strong>W:</strong> Up to 168 mph</li><li><strong>Y:</strong> Up to 186 mph</li></ul></li><li readability=3><p><strong>Tire identification number (TIN):</strong> The TIN represents information about the tire’s manufacturing location, tire size, and week and year it was produced, through a series of numbers and letters.</p></li><li readability=2><p><strong>Uniform tire quality grading (UTQG):</strong> The UTQG is a three-number rating system that provides information on treadwear, traction, and temperature resistance. Higher values indicate better performance.</p></li><li readability=0><p><strong>Treadwear/traction/temperature ratings:</strong> These are specific grades indicating the tire's performance characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Treadwear:</strong> A higher number indicates longer tread life.</li><li><strong>Traction:</strong> Rated from AA to C, with AA being the highest traction.</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Rated from A to C, with A being the highest resistance to heat.</li><li><strong>Maximum inflation pressure:</strong> The maximum pressure the tire can handle is listed in pounds per square inch (psi). Check your vehicle's recommended tire specifications in the owner's manual or on the vehicle's placard to ensure compatibility and optimal performance.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=taking-care-of-your-all-terrain-tires>Taking care of your all-terrain tires</h2><p>According to Cole, you should always refer to the tire manufacturer's recommendations and specifications for proper care and maintenance to maximize the lifespan of your chosen tires. Generally speaking, you should conduct regular inspections and rotations, ensure proper inflation and alignment, and avoid overloading your all-terrain tires.</p><p>Related: <a rel=alternate href=#>Best Tonneau Covers to Outfit Your Truck</a></p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do all-terrain tires last longer than regular tires?</h3><p>As is the case with all tires, longevity depends on driving habits, maintenance, and quality. Though the softer tread used for all-terrain tires can make for a shorter lifespan, if used properly there’s no reason high quality all-terrain tires can’t last as long as standard tires.</p><h3>What are the disadvantages of all-terrain tires?</h3><p>Potential disadvantages of all-terrain tires include road noise and road handling, fuel efficiency, tread wear, cost, weight, and aesthetics.</p><h3>What is the difference between rugged terrain and all-terrain?</h3><p>The use of the terms “rugged terrain” and “all-terrain” may vary by tread patterns and other features depending on the brand. They’re often used interchangeably.</p><h3>Are all-terrain tires better in rain?</h3><p>It depends. The tread design on all-terrain tires can prevent hydroplaning by channeling water away from the tire; however, performance in rain can still vary by the model and brand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkaG5bsDEq6maoZ5iwaq%2BxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pour-ladcf-il-faut-anticiper-le-declin-des-commerces-en-peripherie.html><span>←</span><span>Pour l'AdCF, il faut anticiper le dclin des commerces en priphrie</span></a>
