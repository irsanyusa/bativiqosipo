The woman was sorting her mom’s things after her funeral and found a&nbsp;diary that she had no&nbsp;idea ever existed. Her mother made many entries in&nbsp;this diary, but there was something that became an&nbsp;eye-opening discovery for the woman, who didn’t even suspect that such dramatic events had been happening in&nbsp;her own family, with her own parents.</p><p><h2>The woman’s mom died and the grief was immense.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1a8/38d/48efcf5384b60b5f8d97e7f28d.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman, 36, named Helen, wrote&nbsp;us a&nbsp;letter and told&nbsp;us a&nbsp;story that happened in&nbsp;her family and which has now become a&nbsp;thing that is&nbsp;ruining her own life.</p><p>Helen started her letter, saying that her mother passed recently from cancer and this was the biggest grief of&nbsp;Helen’s life, which she’s still recovering from. The woman wrote, «My&nbsp;mom died of&nbsp;cancer one month ago. I&nbsp;had been taking care of&nbsp;her during the past two years, and&nbsp;I was watching her slowly declining, day by&nbsp;day, without being able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything for her. She was diagnosed too late, and neither of&nbsp;the chemo therapies she went through, helped her. I&nbsp;was prepared for the fact that mom would pass soon, but when it&nbsp;happened, my&nbsp;grief was so&nbsp;overwhelming that&nbsp;I couldn’t even cry my&nbsp;pain out, I&nbsp;was just numb.»</p><p>Helen revealed that she had a&nbsp;special kind of&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with her late mom. The woman wrote, «My&nbsp;mom loved me&nbsp;more than anything. She would spoil&nbsp;me, she would be&nbsp;my&nbsp;best friend, my&nbsp;wisest mentor, my&nbsp;most loving person in&nbsp;the universe. I&nbsp;paid her with a&nbsp;doubled love in&nbsp;return, we&nbsp;were very close.»</p><p>Surprisingly, Helen’s relationship with her brother wasn’t of&nbsp;the same kind as&nbsp;with her mom. The woman revealed, «My&nbsp;older brother, Sam, is&nbsp;the person whom&nbsp;I have never been able to&nbsp;fully understand. He&nbsp;has always been very distant with&nbsp;me, since my&nbsp;childhood, and&nbsp;I didn’t see any obvious reason for&nbsp;it. No, he&nbsp;wasn’t aggressive to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and he&nbsp;never offended&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;was just behaving like&nbsp;I was having some disease that would spread on&nbsp;him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;contacted with&nbsp;me, this has always been so&nbsp;weird, provided our mom loved&nbsp;us both equally, and there wasn’t any discrimination in&nbsp;our family.»</p><p><h2>Things started to&nbsp;get wrong right after the mother’s funeral.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/095/69c/1d49765dab923fa2fe80c3ba5d.jpg><p>Helen goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, that after her mom’s funeral, her brother approached her and said they needed to&nbsp;talk. Helen revealed, «Sam insisted that&nbsp;I don’t touch mom’s thing by&nbsp;any means, and he&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;would sort them, and then he’d take the things he’d want to&nbsp;keep and let me&nbsp;choose the ones&nbsp;I would want to&nbsp;keep, too. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;much overwhelmed by&nbsp;my&nbsp;grief that I&nbsp;agreed, but in&nbsp;heart of&nbsp;hearts, I&nbsp;knew this was so&nbsp;wrong from Sam’s side to&nbsp;not allow me&nbsp;to&nbsp;touch mom’s things.»</p><p>But then, Sam’s wife started giving birth, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;out-of-schedule delivery and Sam rushed to&nbsp;his family to&nbsp;support his wife. So, Helen decided to&nbsp;use the opportunity and started to&nbsp;sort mom’s things alone.</p><p>Helen said, «I&nbsp;thought that it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;just unfair if&nbsp;someone, even if&nbsp;it’s my&nbsp;brother, would prohibit me&nbsp;to&nbsp;approach the belongings of&nbsp;my&nbsp;dearest person on&nbsp;Earth. I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;ignore Sam’s conditions and started looking through mom’s things alone. I&nbsp;thought that&nbsp;I would keep only a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;them, and&nbsp;I was sure that Sam wouldn’t want them, as&nbsp;they had no&nbsp;special meaning for him. So, I&nbsp;thought everything was fair enough. And now&nbsp;I wish&nbsp;I actually listened to&nbsp;Sam and never approached mom’s stuff, because what&nbsp;I found in&nbsp;the process is&nbsp;now taking a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.»</p><p><h2>The woman found her mom’s diary and read&nbsp;it, despite being asked not&nbsp;to.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf9/6af/59e56f57ea9d4d45674755e2e2.jpg><p>Helen goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «I&nbsp;was looking through my&nbsp;late mom’s belongings, when&nbsp;I suddenly came across a&nbsp;very old, half-torn book. It&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;mom’s personal diary, and she had been actively writing entries in&nbsp;it&nbsp;only for 2&nbsp;years, which was even before&nbsp;I was born.»</p><p>Helen revealed that the title page contained some handwritten text, in&nbsp;which her mom asked anyone who’d find this diary to&nbsp;keep away from it&nbsp;and to&nbsp;respect her privacy. Despite this warning, Helen overcame her remorse and started reading&nbsp;it.</p><p>The woman said, «I&nbsp;knew&nbsp;I was doing a&nbsp;very disrespectful thing while ignoring mom’s prohibition to&nbsp;read the content of&nbsp;this book. But I&nbsp;was grieving, I&nbsp;needed a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life so&nbsp;badly, and&nbsp;I felt she would forgive me&nbsp;for reading through her diary.»</p><p>Helen added, «While reading&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;finally understood why my&nbsp;brother had been behaving in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;weird way during all my&nbsp;conscious life. The fact is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;not my&nbsp;brother, but my...Father!»</p><p><h2>The woman’s revelation was a&nbsp;real knock down for her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61e/0a3/552e155ee6bc56162befb6a7e0.jpg><p>Helen explained, «Mom wrote that when she married my&nbsp;dad, he&nbsp;had three adult children, and she had none. Mom and dad both wanted to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;kid together, but dad had serious health issues, which brought severe complications and one of&nbsp;them was that he&nbsp;couldn’t have kids anymore.»</p><p>Helen continues, saying, «Mom wrote that they didn’t want to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;male donor’s material for fertilization, so&nbsp;they asked dad’s son, Sam, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the actual donor. According to&nbsp;mom, they both felt that was the best decision. She explained it&nbsp;in&nbsp;her diary that their kid would have dad’s genes, and they knew Sam’s health, personality, and intelligence, which made him a&nbsp;very good donor. And Sam agreed to&nbsp;help.»</p><p>Helen concluded, «So, I’m 36&nbsp;now. And I&nbsp;know now that my&nbsp;„father“ is&nbsp;my&nbsp;grandfather, my&nbsp;„brother“ is&nbsp;my&nbsp;father, my&nbsp;two „sisters“ are my&nbsp;aunts. Mom wrote that she and dad had been anxious and confused about telling me&nbsp;about this. Dad passed many years ago and took this secret to&nbsp;the grave with him, and now mom passed, and this <a href=# title=truth data-link=tag>truth</a> was revealed after her death. I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I just could hear this all from her, this would have explained so&nbsp;much for&nbsp;me.»</p><p><h2>Helen doesn’t know how to&nbsp;live with this truth now.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fea/c7c/24d06557578fe550c0148e4f14.jpg><p>Helen revealed that after she found out this family secret, she «couldn’t recover from shock.»</p><p>The woman said, «This all was so&nbsp;unexpected, and it’s now making my&nbsp;relationship with Sam almost impossible. I&nbsp;called him right after&nbsp;I found out, and firstly, I&nbsp;congratulated him with the birth of&nbsp;his baby boy, and then&nbsp;I told him that&nbsp;I was aware of&nbsp;the truth. He&nbsp;was numb, and then he&nbsp;started shouting at&nbsp;me, blaming it&nbsp;on&nbsp;me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I read the diary without permission, and he&nbsp;even started calling me&nbsp;names and directly offending&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;had never done this before, I&nbsp;was shocked and scared, and&nbsp;I thought this was the end to&nbsp;our relationship at&nbsp;all.»</p><p>Helen concluded, «Sam and&nbsp;I cut ties, but&nbsp;I find it&nbsp;so&nbsp;painful, and&nbsp;I really want him back in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;him about everything, and&nbsp;I want&nbsp;us to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;healthy relationship after&nbsp;I found out the secrets of&nbsp;the past. But he&nbsp;completely disappeared from my&nbsp;life, and&nbsp;I don’t even know how he&nbsp;named his baby. I&nbsp;feel like I’m dead for him now, but&nbsp;I can’t see what my&nbsp;fault&nbsp;is.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story about a&nbsp;woman, whose life will never be&nbsp;the same again after she found an&nbsp;ordinary tampon in&nbsp;her husband’s belongings. This led her to&nbsp;such a&nbsp;<a href=#>shocking discovery</a> that she now wants to&nbsp;run away from her beloved spouse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuss6upZ1lna56rrvMrGSsnZOnsrV5w6KYq7FdlruledGerZ6ZnJqxbq2Mn5imoZyuerSxwqucrWWkna61ecisZJ2do6m%2FsMXIp55mpaliuaqyxGalqK9dbX55gJRpZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./avec-openstreetmap-lannion-se-reapproprie-son-territoire-numerique.html><span>←</span><span>Avec OpenStreetMap, Lannion se rapproprie son territoire numrique</span></a>
