As the daughter of <a href=#>Sheikh Mujibur Rahman</a>, the nation's founding father, Sheikh Hasina's leadership has been influential in shaping modern Bangladesh.</p><p>Born into a political family, Sheikh Hasina's early years were impacted by her father's imprisonment for his political activities. She pursued higher education in literature at Dhaka University and married scientist M. A. Wazed Miah. The assassination of most of her family in 1975 led to her extended exile in India.</p><p>Her political career began to rise after returning to Bangladesh in 1981. As President of the Awami League, she played a key role in the pro-democracy movements and became Leader of the Opposition in 1991. Her first term as Prime Minister witnessed significant economic progress and the signing of pivotal treaties.</p><p>From 2006 to 2008, during a period of political unrest, Hasina faced detention under corruption charges. She was released before the 2008 election, which she won. Hasina's subsequent terms have been marked by economic advancements and international engagement. Her government's decision to host Rohingya refugees gained global attention, and she has received accolades for her leadership.</p><p>Hasina's administration has faced criticism over human rights issues and limits on freedom of speech, however, as evidenced by the passage of the Digital Security Act. Despite controversies, Sheikh Hasina has made contributions to literature and survived several assassination attempts.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>September 28</a>, <a href=#>1947</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Tungipara, Gopalganj, East Bengal, Pakistan (now Bangladesh)<br><b>Age: <a href=#>76 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Baby Boomer</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Pig</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Libra</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1996-06-12</a> Bangladesh Awami League wins 146 of 300 seats in general election, bringing Sheikh Hasina to power for her first term as Prime Minister with the support of the Jatiya Party</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2014-01-07</a> Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina wins re-election in Bangladesh general election</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2018-12-31</a> Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina wins third term in Bangladesh elections with 17 people killed in violent clashes</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2022-12-10</a> Tens of thousands of people protest in Dhaka, Bangladesh, against the government demanding resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and new elections amid cost of living crisis</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2024-01-07</a> Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina wins her fourth term in office amid controversial election marred by opposition boycotts with over 10,000 activists arrested</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Bangladeshis</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwv8eeoKSgXZ2utLXNmg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mapping-scooters-explosive-growth-state-by-state-and-country-by-country.html><span>←</span><span>Mapping Scooters Explosive Growth, State by State and Country by Country</span></a>
