And much like Trump, his time out of office has been dominated by <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>multiple legal imbroglios</a> — problems that he could kick down the road by winning the presidency and accompanying legal immunity.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite his controversial premiership, he remains one of the nation’s most popular politicians, and looks likely to take the lead in the first round of presidential elections with about 28% of the vote. Czech outlet <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Seznam Zprávy’s polling</a> found a 40% plurality prefers a president with a neutral geopolitical stance, compared with 34% who want a president with the pro-Western stance of Petr Fiala, the current prime minister who handles day-to-day governance in the Czech system.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Sonnet Frisbie, Morning Consult’s managing director for geopolitical risk analysis in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the subject of Ukrainian refugees — 476,000 of whom remain in the country according to the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>UNHCR</a>, the third-highest figure in Europe — has also loomed large in Czech politics in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“There has been a lot of anxiety over the burden on social services after the initial wave of refugees arrived, but that may play less of a role in political discourse as many refugees move into Germany and other E.U. countries,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And as the war in Ukraine has shifted voter perceptions more in favor of Brussels, the same positions that once boosted&nbsp; Babis’ political career now seem to be compounding the damage to his reputation caused by his legal problems. Ahead of the first round of elections on Friday and Saturday, polling averages show that either of the two candidates supported by the incumbent government will beat Babis in the second round by around <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>20 percentage points.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOnLGem5hivbOx0qKbnqaknq6tecSlnJysmaS7br%2FUq62esQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./simon-cowell-stops-family-singing-group-in-agt-early-release-audition.html><span>←</span><span>Simon Cowell Stops Family Singing Group in 'AGT' Early Release Audition</span></a>
