The American Idol alum recently performed at Princess of Wales’ third annual Christmas carol service, held at Westminster Abbey last Friday.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-adam-lambert-performs-for-royal-family-at-princess-kate-s-christmas-carol-concert>Adam Lambert Performs for Royal Family at Princess Kate’s Christmas Carol Concert</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lambert</a> was among the artists enlisted to perform at the princess’ third annual Together At Christmas carol concert. The singer sang “The Christmas Song” alongside British singer-songwriter Beverley Knight, ahead of Prince William’s Bible reading.</p><p>An attendee said that William and Kate’s children—George, Charlotte and Louis —”watched intently” as the pair sang. As per Lambert, the atmosphere inside Westminster Abbey was totally tranquil when they belted out the song.</p><p>“Very still, which added a calmness to my energy. The song felt sort of like a lullaby,” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> People.</p><p>According to the singer, it was remarkable to perform in the historic abbey. In the same interview, he was able to communicate with Princess Kate before he went on stage.</p><p>“I had the honor of meeting Catherine, Princess of Wales. She invited the performers she wanted to see at the service, and it was lovely to visit with her before we performed,” Lambert said. “It’s a really flattering invite to receive from Princess Kate, to come and sing at this special event.”</p><p>The Christmas concert was in relation to Princess Kate’s Shaping Up Campaign, which began in early 2023. The campaign was specifically launched to “help support parents and caregivers provide loving, safe and secure homes for their babies and young children to thrive.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-gushes-over-the-opportunity>The Singer Gushes Over the Opportunity</h2><p>After his journey on season eight of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a>, the singer proceeded to take over the world, performing in different stages from typical to grand. Yet, Lambert said Westminster Abbey has a different magic in itself.</p><p>“I’ve always loved history and old architecture, and this is sort of my sweet spot. I was able to walk around a little bit after my rehearsal and just kind of take a little self-guided tour of some of the areas inside at the Abbey and it’s just breathtaking, and the amount of history in here is nuts,” he said. “You know you have the tombs of monarchs and poets and other iconic historical figures, so it’s pretty wild.”</p><p>Reflecting on the recent milestone, Lambert stated that he feels privileged to be included in the exclusive lineup.</p><p>“It’s such an honor to be performing at the Westminster Abbey, a place that I’ve seen on television and in photos for years but have never been to myself, so it is quite breathtaking.”</p><p>Together At Christmas carol concert is not the first time that Lambert has performed for the Royal Family. He also sung during BBC’s Platinum Party at the Palace concert to celebrate <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Queen Elizabeth</a>’s Platinum Jubilee.</p><p>“I’ve performed for the royals during the Queen’s Jubilee but they were quite far away on the other side of the crowd,” he said. “So this will be sort of up close and personal and hopefully bringing Christmas cheer to people that tune in on Christmas Eve.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_RebeccaFerguson_Dave-HoganGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘X Factor’ Runner-Up Rebecca Ferguson Details Her ‘Abusive’ Experience in The Music Industry" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>adam lambert</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wJ2YpmWclrqjsdGtZKKrXZ28r7vRnptmrJ9iwKq6xmaYrWWblsGmecyim52klam8r7%2BMnJ%2BroaOpuqK%2FjJyYq6ecYrCwusKeqa1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./actor-pernell-roberts-dies-at-81-1118014287.html><span>←</span><span>Actor Pernell Roberts dies at 81</span></a>
