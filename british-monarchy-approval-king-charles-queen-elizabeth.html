By the time she was coronated 27 years later, the empire was rapidly collapsing, with <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>India and Pakistan</a> and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Israel</a> already independent and British troops attempting to suppress liberation movements in <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Kenya</a> and <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>British Malaya</a>. Meanwhile, Gamal Abdel Nasr’s coup in <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Egypt</a> threatened the Suez Canal, the keystone of Britain’s thalassocracy.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Elizabeth’s reign would coincide with waning U.K. power over every remaining possession save a few small islands and exclaves scattered around the globe, with more and more former subjects dissociating from the British Commonwealth <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>right up to the end</a>.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Overseeing the disentanglement of an empire is an unenviable fate for any monarch, but more than three-quarters of adults in the United Kingdom say the queen carried out her largely symbolic duties “very well” compared to previous monarchs. Fewer than 5% say she was not up to par.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The queen’s heir, though, takes the throne amid much lower expectations from his subjects, with just 39% saying they think he will perform “very well.” King Charles III’s favorability is also 17 percentage points lower than his mother’s (66% to 83%) and only 31% of British adults say they have a “very favorable” view of him, compared with 62% who say the same about the late queen.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As people born long after the height of the empire — and who in many cases have family roots in communities once oppressed by the crown — become an increasingly large part of the British populace, the monarchy may struggle to retain the same esteem of its subjects as it enjoyed in the second Elizabethan era.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">And while there may be questions about the British public’s appetite for a continued Windsor reign, the seismic impact of her death on the country’s consciousness is not in dispute: 88% of adults surveyed said they’d heard “a lot” about her passing, which is the largest share on record for any news event — in any country — that Morning Consult has tested.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>survey</i></a><i> was conducted Sept. 12-14, 2022, among a representative sample of 1,000 adults in the United Kingdom, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOm6mirJmotW65zqeYq5uYrnqivM%2Brpq%2BZnGK4qrrGZpqhmaKhsrR50K6cnqZdmrmqxsCbnK2g</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-reserve-citoyenne-tournee-vers-la-gestion-de-crise.html><span>←</span><span>Une &amp;quot;rserve citoyenne&amp;quot; tourne vers la gestion de crise</span></a>
