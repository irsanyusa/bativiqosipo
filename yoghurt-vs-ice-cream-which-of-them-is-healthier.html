<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Yoghurt vs Ice-cream: Which of them is healthier?</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Either way, you might need to start taking more of frozen yoghurt because it's a healthy alternative to ice cream if you want to save a few calories while still enjoying a sweet treat. According to research, frozen yoghurt has about 25 fewer calories than ice cream and only a third of its saturated fats.</p><p>Ice cream is made with cream, a key ingredient that distinguishes it from frozen yogurt. Ice cream is also made with milk, eggs yolks, and sugar. Frozen yohurt consists of yogurt made from milk, including milk solids and milk fats. It also contains corn syrup, flavorings, gelatin, emulsifiers, and yogurt culture.</p><p>For lovers of ice-cream, it might be hard to quit the sweet dessert. This article will give you the reasons you need to ditch ice-cream for frozen yoghurt. Here are the reasons frozen yoghurt is healthier than ice-cream.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>1. Fat content</strong></p><p>The presence of cream explains why ice cream is higher in fat than frozen yoghurt. Regular ice cream contains about 10 percent milkfat while frozen yogurt contains 4 percent or less. Since the flavor of ice cream depends on its fat content, the higher the quality, the more the fat content. For example, gelato contains about 20% fat content.</p><p><strong>2. Presence of probiotics</strong></p><p>Frozen yoghurt is considered a healthy food, not just a snack or dessert because it contains probiotics. This is a healthy bacteria that aids digestion and boosts the immune system by catalyzing the production of essential vitamins that keep the body fine-tuned. Ice cream has no yogurt cultures.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-cd1554b2-b0c6-4940-978b-607ece484f65 data-caption="The nutritional content of frozen yogurt is different from ice-cream [Spoon University]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/ehdktkpTURBXy8wMDVlNjM3YWM1N2MxMjRlYzVjZjQ5OTBkMjFkMDI0Yy5qcGeRlQLNAxbNAgzCww></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>3. Nutritional content</strong></p><p>Frozen yoghurt contains carbohydrates, protein and vitamins, all in higher quantities than ice cream, and it also packs a healthy dose of calcium which aids in strengthening bones, keeping the heart in good shape, and also helps in losing weight.</p><p><strong>4. Safe for lactose intolerance</strong></p><p>People with lactose intolerance are always tempted by taking ice-cream, which is very unhealthy for them. Frozen yoghurt is good for these sets of people, unlike ice cream which is rich in lactose thus a no-no in cases of indigestion for both adults and kids.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>5. Safe for diabetic patients</strong></p><p>Diabetic patients can also have sugar free frozen yoghurt because lactose (milk sugars) which is present in milk and ice cream, is broken down by the live cultures in yoghurt making it healthy for diabetics.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOwu8Nmq6uZppq5cMXOoJ%2BuqqRiw7R5yJycZpuimq6uedahoJygXaSzbsDHnqRmoaNitaaty62fop2iZH25vcSkmZ8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paris-pret-quintupler-la-taxe-dhabitation-sur-les-residences-secondaires.html><span>←</span><span>Paris prt quintupler la taxe d'habitation sur les rsidences secondaires ?</span></a>
