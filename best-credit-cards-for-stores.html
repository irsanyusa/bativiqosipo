It doesn’t offer a welcome bonus, and its bonus categories are a bit on the niche side. But there are some unique aspects to what it offers.</p><p>The card earns “Daily Cash,” which is effectively cash back that you can redeem toward a statement credit on your card (or in other ways within the Apple universe). Daily cash is deposited instantly into your rewards account—so when you swipe your card, your available cash balance will increase the same day. Pretty handy, as many other credit cards won’t deposit your rewards until after your billing cycle.</p><p>The card earns:</p><ul><li>3% back at Apple when you use Apple Pay</li><li>3% back at Nike, Panera, Walgreens, T-Mobile, Duane Reade, Uber/Uber Eats, Exxon Mobil, and Ace Hardware</li><li>2% back on all purchases when you use Apple Pay</li><li>1% back on all other eligible purchases</li></ul><p>One of the big selling points of the card is the ability to set up monthly installments for Apple purchases. If you’re always purchasing Apple products, this card gives you the power to buy new Apple products and pay over time without incurring interest.</p><p><h3 class=accordion-title>Card details:</h3></p><ul><li>Most credit cards emphasize your minimum amount due. But when you pay only your minimum each month, it costs you a lot in interest over time. Apple Card is different. When you’re ready to make a payment, Apple Card estimates the interest you’ll wind up paying, based on any payment amount you choose. And it does that in real time, so you can make an informed decision about how much of your balance to pay down.</li><li>When you buy something using Apple Card, you get a percentage of your purchase back in Daily Cash — not a month from now, but every day. It’s real cash, so unlike rewards, it never expires or loses its value. You can choose to have it automatically deposited onto your Apple Cash card in the Wallet app, and it’s ready to send or spend however you’d like. Or you can open a Savings account with Apple Card and route your Daily Cash directly into the account, where it can earn interest. And there’s no limit to how much Daily Cash you can get. Use it to buy things in stores, on websites, and in apps. Make a payment on your Apple Card. Pay back a friend. Or save it up and watch it grow over time.</li><li>Apple Card gives you unlimited 3% Daily Cash back on everything you buy at Apple — whether it’s a new Mac, an iPhone case, games from the App Store, or even a service like Apple Music or Apple TV+. You also get 3% Daily Cash back on purchases you make at select merchants when you use Apple Card with Apple Pay.</li><li>With Apple Card Family, you can share Apple Card with a Co‑Owner and add up to four Participants to one easy-to-manage account.</li><li>If you’re an Owner or Co-Owner on an Apple Card account, you can now use your Daily Cash to help build a better long-term financial foundation. Simply open a Savings account to have your Daily Cash automatically routed into a high-yield savings account. You can set it up in just a few steps and manage it all right in Wallet. No minimum deposits, no fees, no balance requirements. You can even deposit additional money into your Savings account from your Apple Cash balance, from the bank account linked to your Apple Card, or from any other bank. You’re free to move money in and out as you see fit, and you can stop routing your Daily Cash to Savings at any time.</li><li>Balance transfer fee: N/A</li><li>Cash advance fee: N/A</li><li>Foreign transaction fee: N/A</li></ul><p><h3 class=accordion-title>Pros & cons:</h3></p><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Daily automatic cash back instantly available.</li><li>No annual fee, late fee, or foreign transaction fee.</li><li>Apple Payment Plan lets you pay over time at a low interest rate (0% for Apple products).</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>No welcome or sign-up bonus.</li><li>No purchase protection.</li><li>Apple Pay is not accepted everywhere.</li></ul><h3>Best for home renovations: Lowe’s Advantage Card</h3><p><span class=best-for>Home renovations</span></p><p><span class=best-for>Home renovations</span></p><h3 class=product-title>Lowes Advantage Card</h3><p>Credit score needed</p><p>Good</p><p>Annual fees</p><p>$0</p><p>Welcome offer</p><p>20% discount</p><p><h3 class=accordion-title>Why we like it:</h3></p><p>The no-annual-fee Lowe’s Advantage Card has a very generous return rate for in-store purchases that’ll interest anyone who does meaningful spending at Lowe’s.

If you take advantage of the card’s interest-free financing, but you fail to pay off the purchase in full before the 0% APR period ends, you’ll be retroactively charged all the interest you would have accrued.

Don’t opt for it if you aren’t absolutely certain that you can pay off your purchase in time.</p><p>To make matters worse, the My Best Buy Card charges a variable interest rate above 30%.

In other words, if a credit card had excellent perks but has only a small footprint in the Midwest, we did not include it.</p><h2 id=how-to-pick-the-best-store-credit-cards>How to pick the best store credit cards</h2><h3>Identify your spending habits</h3><p>Too often, customers get talked into opening a card at checkout just to receive a 15% discount on their $70 cart. Don’t acquiesce unless you shop at that particular store a lot—and you know that opening another credit card will be a net positive to your wallet.</p><p>And don’t let the cashier’s rousing spiel cause you to make any decisions you otherwise wouldn’t.</p><h3>Weigh the benefits</h3><p>Credit cards can sometimes become little more than an accessory. If you’re passionate about your favorite store, you may just want a credit card that signals to everyone else your enthusiasm about the retailer.</p><p>Make sure the benefits that come with the card are actually worth your application. If a card’s main feature is its ability to confer special financing for large purchases, and that’s something you’ll never use, a simple cash back card would likely be a bigger win for you.</p><h3>Understand the fees</h3><p>You can bet that whichever store card you’re considering has its share of nickel-and-dime terms and conditions buried in the mouse type. Whether its astonishingly high interest rates for balances carried month-to-month or big fees, read carefully before you sign up.</p><h2 id=more-on-store-credit-cards>More on store credit cards</h2><h3>What is a store credit card?</h3><p>A store credit card is not to be confused ​​with a “store card.” While both offer unique perks for a specific merchant, they’ve got one massive difference.</p><p>A store card can only be used at the issuing store. It can’t be used, for example, at the gas station on the way home. A store credit card can be used anywhere, just like any other credit card. Store credit cards are valuable for those who do a lot of shopping at the same place, but want the freedom to use the card elsewhere if they want.</p><h3>Store credit cards: pros and cons</h3><table class="wrapper__Table-sc-1nbwfq1-1 iYXWdO not-prose"><tr class="wrapper__Tr-sc-1nbwfq1-4 oGfrp"></tr><tbody class="wrapper__Tbody-sc-1nbwfq1-5 kklmFK" readability=30><tr class=table-row readability=4><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Statement credits and memberships for specific brands</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Welcome bonuses much smaller than the best rewards credit cards</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=4><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Rewards are focused on your favorite merchants</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Limited value outside the cobranded store</p></td></tr><tr class=table-row readability=2><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell" readability=4><p>Special financing occasionally offered for store purchases</p></td><td class="card__Td-sc-a2uqyv-0 kPvALb table-cell"><p>High interest rates</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>When should you get a store credit card?</h3><p>If you find yourself consistently shopping at the same merchant, it could be worthwhile to check out its credit card options. Even if you use a cash back credit card with a solid return on all spending as your daily driver, a store card could have an even higher earning rate, opportunities for 0% interest financing, and big discounts at checkout.</p><h3>Tips to leverage a store credit card</h3><p>Read the fine print. Store cards can come with less-than-friendly terms. You want to know where the booby traps are so you can avoid them. For example, when a card charges deferred interest, that means it won’t charge you interest for carrying a balance for a specific amount of time. If you fail to pay off your purchase within that window, you’ll receive one massive interest fee in the amount of all the APR that you would have accrued during the months you carried a balance.</p><p>Time the welcome bonus. Some store credit cards come with a welcome offer in the form of a rebate for your next purchase (or series of purchases). If the card you want has a similar time-sensitive bonus, be sure you open it at the right time to maximize its value.</p><p>Practice healthy credit card habits. Use your store credit card as you do your other credit cards. Pay your balances in full each month to avoid interest charges; keep your credit utilization low. If you're taking advantage of a <a rel=alternate href=#>0% intro APR offer</a>, pay your bill in full before it ends.</p><h2 id=alternatives-to-store-credit-cards>Alternatives to store credit cards</h2><p>It’s often the case that a credit card not affiliated with a specific merchant can give you the biggest bang for your swipe. You’ll find many cash back and <a rel=alternate href=#>travel rewards cards</a> have more generous <a rel=alternate href=#>purchase protection</a>, higher welcome bonuses, and more versatile rewards.</p><p>For example, the no annual fee <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Citi Double Cash® Card</a> earns 1% back when you make a purchase and 1% back when you pay off that purchase.

It’s possible to get a store card, such as the Fingerhut Credit Card, but it’s better to work on improving your score to at least “good” (defined as 670 or above by FICO) before prioritizing rewards.</p><h3>Which store credit cards are hard to get?</h3><p>Store credit cards aren’t particularly hard to get.
