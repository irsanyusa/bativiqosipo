This makes <a rel=alternate href=#>Hilton points</a> uniquely valuable. You’re almost certain to be within proximity of a points-eligible hotel as long as you’re not venturing too far away from civilization.</p><p>Hilton’s portfolio includes popular brands such as Hampton Inn, DoubleTree, Home2 Suites, Hilton Garden Inn, and Homewood Suites. It also harbors some of the world’s fanciest hotels with its luxury brands Waldorf Astoria, Conrad, and LXR. No matter the occasion, you can probably find a Hilton that fits the theme of your trip.</p><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*annual_fees*,*api*:*cc*}>annual_fees</span></span>-annual fee <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> (<a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Rates & Fees</a>) is one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best credit cards</a> to rack up Hilton points in a hurry. In no time, you’ll find that you’ve got enough rewards to book your next hotel stay for practically free.</p><h2 id=times-take>TIME's Take</h2><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 iOsbzs"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*LogoImageCardDetailsLink*,*api*:*cc*} rel=nofollow href=#></a></span><p>We give the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> a solid 3.8 out of 5 stars. When it comes to <a rel=alternate href=#>no-annual-fee credit cards</a>, the card is above average due to its incredible welcome bonus and ability to unlock Hilton’s “fifth-night free” perk when redeeming points to book five or more consecutive nights.</p><p>However, the card’s lack of any other meat-and-potatoes Hilton benefits means it’s not a good option for Hilton regulars. Other cards, such as the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card, can garner you significantly more value—though you’ll have to pay an annual fee.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-card-for>Who is the card for?</h2><p>If you’re just beginning in the world of <a rel=alternate href=#>travel credit cards</a>, the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> is a no-risk way to start your journey. The card doesn’t charge an annual fee, so there’s nothing to lose, even if you later decide that the card’s not a good fit for you.</p><p>The card comes with a large welcome bonus: <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*bonus_miles_full*,*api*:*cc*}>bonus_miles_full</span></span>. That’s potentially enough for up to over two weeks of free stays at Hilton hotels, depending on which properties you choose to redeem your points. Once you’ve reserved a free night for the first time, you’ll understand the allure of hotel points.</p><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> is an introductory card for travelers keen to earn free hotel stays from their spending without any upfront cost. If you book Hilton hotels regularly, the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> might not be the best option. Other annual fee-incurring Hilton credit cards offer much better benefits, some of which could potentially net you over $1,000 in value each year.</p><h2 id=rewards-structure>Rewards structure</h2><h3>Earning Hilton points</h3><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> earns points at the following rates:</p><ul><li>7 points per dollar spent at a Hilton hotel or resort.</li><li>5 points per dollar at eligible U.S. restaurants, U.S. gas stations, and U.S. supermarkets.</li><li>3 points per dollar for all other eligible purchases.</li></ul><p>This is a solid return rate for a no-annual-fee card. You can quite easily rack up points for your most common expenses, namely groceries and restaurants. Even a family of two should be able to accrue over 50,000 points per year from these expenses alone.</p><h3>Redeeming Hilton points</h3><p>You can generally book Hilton hotels for between 5,000 points per night (for an extremely basic roadside hotel) and 95,000 points per night (for the Instagrammable, overwater-bungalow, powdered-sugar-beach-touting resorts). There are even a handful of resorts that charge up to 150,000 points. Prices vary based on the hotel, time of year, and cost of the room.</p><p>Hilton points don’t have a flat value. The return you’ll get from them depends on which property you use them for. For example, the Home2 Suites in Dayton usually cost around $200 after taxes. But you can pay 40,000 points to stay for free. That means you’ll get a value of approximately 0.50 cents per point.</p><p>On the other hand, when we checked the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Grand Wailea, A Waldorf Astoria Resort</a> in Maui, it cost $1,525 per night after taxes, including the $50 nightly resort fee, or 110,000 points, plus the $50 fee. This translates to a value of 1.34 cents per point.</p><p>You can also use your points in other ways, though you’re almost certain to get a poor value for them. You can:</p><ul><li>Transfer them to over 20 airline partners. The transfer ratio is often 10:1.</li><li>Redeem them for Amazon purchases at a rate of 0.2 cents per point.</li><li>Redeem them to offset your Lyft rides at a rate of 0.22 cents per point.</li><li>Donate them to charity at a rate of 0.25 cents per point.</li></ul><p>Returns on these alternative options are low, so it’s best to use them only if you don’t have enough Hilton points for a free night—and you don’t foresee yourself earning more. It’s better to get some value from your points instead of never using them.</p><p>Be aware, however, that Hilton allows you to pool points for free with up to 10 friends and family members. Transferring points to a loved one may be a smarter idea if they can extract better value from them</p><h2 id=additional-hidden-perks>Additional hidden perks</h2><h3>Silver elite status</h3><p>This card provides automatic Hilton Silver elite status. This isn’t particularly valuable: highlights include things like a 20% bonus on eligible Hilton purchases and free bottled water.</p><p>However, Silver status does come with one dynamite perk that can save you tons: You’ll receive the fifth night free when booking award stays of five or more consecutive nights. I used this perk to book five nights at the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi</a> and racked up 150,000 points during a single stay.</p><h3>Ability to earn Gold elite status</h3><p>Hilton Gold status is much more valuable than Silver status. It comes with breakfast credits when staying at a domestic Hilton and free breakfast when international. It also gives you 80% bonus points on Hilton purchases and room upgrades when available.</p><p>Normally, Gold status requires that you achieve one of the following in a calendar year:</p><ul><li>Stay 40 nights with Hilton.</li><li>Complete 20 stays with Hilton.</li><li>Earn 75,000 base points (Hilton awards 10 base points per dollar at most hotels).</li></ul><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> holders, however, can earn Gold status by making at least $20,000 in eligible purchases in a calendar year with the card.</p><p>This would be a notable benefit if Gold elite status weren’t so easy to earn with other cards. For $95 a year, both the Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card and the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="The Hilton Honors American Express Business Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4028102*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> come with automatic Gold elite status—and the ability to upgrade to top-tier Diamond status after meeting minimum spending requirements.</p><h3>Amex Offers</h3><p>This perk is not unique to the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="The Hilton Honors American Express Business Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4028102*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span>. All Amex cards (even its debit cards) come with Amex Offers. However, it’s still one of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best ongoing American Express credit card</a> benefits around.</p><p>Amex Offers are targeted statement credits or bonus points-earning opportunities that reward you for everyday spending.You can find them in your online account. When you find one that fits your spending habits (for example, earn $15 back when spending at least $100 on your wireless phone bill), simply add it to your card, and the offer will automatically activate when you’ve satisfied the terms.</p><p>You can potentially carry hundreds of Amex Offers on your card at once.</p><h3>Travel protections and assistance</h3><p>As this is a travel credit card, you can expect to receive some sort of travel insurance and emergency assistance. No-annual-fee cards aren’t known for elite coverages, and the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> is no exception. You’ll receive:</p><ul><li>Secondary car rental insurance, which covers anything that your primary insurance will not if your rental car is damaged or stolen.</li><li>Global Assist Hotline, which provides you with medical, legal, and other services when you’re at least 100 miles from your home.</li></ul><h3>No foreign transaction fees</h3><p>When transacting with a merchant from outside the U.S., many cards will charge you a foreign transaction fee, which is often <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*foreign_transaction_fee*,*api*:*cc*}>foreign_transaction_fee</span></span> (<a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Rates & Fees</a>)of your purchase.The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> waives this fee, meaning it’s a great card to bring with you when traveling abroad.</p><h3>Purchase protections</h3><p>There are two benefits that make the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><span class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Hilton Honors Card from American Express" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048112*,*field*:*card_name*,*api*:*cc*}>card_name</span></span> a good payment option when making large purchases:</p><ul><li>Extended warranty protection: Up to one year is added to manufacturer’s warranties of five years or less. You will receive up to $10,000 in coverage per eligible purchase (up to $50,000 in total payouts per account each calendar year).</li><li>Purchase protection: Eligible items are covered against theft or damage for 90 days after the purchase date. You’ll get up to $1,000 per item (up to $50,000 per account each calendar year).</li></ul><h2 id=card-alternatives>Card alternatives</h2><p>There are several other Hilton credit cards to choose
