Skye, now&nbsp;53, took to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> to&nbsp;commemorate the memory of&nbsp;her dear <a href=# title=friend data-link=tag>friend</a>, sharing their last heartwarming text exchange and a&nbsp;throwback photo that takes&nbsp;us back to&nbsp;their youth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82b/45e/d9adb35695a1306929adbccf2a.jpg><p>Matthew Perry’s career in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;cinema began with the film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>A&nbsp;Night in&nbsp;the Life of&nbsp;Jimmy Reardon</i></a>, directed by&nbsp;William Richert. In&nbsp;this coming-of-age drama adapted from Richert’s novel, <i>Aren’t You Even Gonna Kiss Me&nbsp;Goodbye?, </i>River Phoenix played the main character, Jimmy Reardon, a&nbsp;middle-class young man navigating life’s challenges after <a href=# title="high school" data-link=tag>high school</a>.</p><p>Perry portrayed his privileged best friend, Fred Roberts, while Ione Skye took on&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;Denise Hunter, his girlfriend. It&nbsp;was this movie that marked the start of&nbsp;a&nbsp;special friendship between Skye and Perry, one that lasted for decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/451/460/14102d5071a79d1f73d270f347.jpg><p>On&nbsp;October&nbsp;15, just 2&nbsp;weeks before Perry’s untimely death, Skye <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>received</a> a&nbsp;heartfelt message from him. Perry’s text began with, “Hi! I&nbsp;hope all is&nbsp;well. I&nbsp;was meditating (I&nbsp;meditate now) and ’In Your Eyes’ started playing. And I&nbsp;instantly thought of&nbsp;how beautiful you are.”</p><p>This was a&nbsp;sweet reference to&nbsp;the iconic scene from Skye’s 1989&nbsp;film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Say Anything</i></a>. Skye responded warmly, expressing her joy at&nbsp;hearing from Perry and assuring him of&nbsp;her cherished memories, writing, “Good to&nbsp;hear from you. I&nbsp;only have nice memories with you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c9/b56/f58612546db78ca32e0acdbecb.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57b/0f1/92193d5fe597a8731a53b81b49.jpg><p>The text exchange between the 2&nbsp;actors was a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the genuine bond they shared. Perry’s message conveyed his fondness for Skye, and her response reflected the affection they had for one another. Perry’s words, which read, “Me&nbsp;too. That one afternoon, I&nbsp;was just sitting in&nbsp;my&nbsp;apartment, and there you were,” captured the spontaneous and enduring nature of&nbsp;their friendship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7c/361/5d5a115a65a8603b3488d057d4.jpg><p>Skye, best known for her role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Say Anything</i></a>, shared her deep sadness on&nbsp;Instagram with a&nbsp;throwback <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>photo</a> of&nbsp;her and Perry, which highlighted their youth and their connection. In&nbsp;her heartfelt caption, Skye wrote, “My&nbsp;last exchange a&nbsp;week ago. I’m very, very sad. Loved this guy.” The post not only highlighted their friendship but also celebrated the memories they created together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/579/0db/5c55ec5f7f83f044f9a9e10e90.jpg><p>Matthew Perry, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> conducted a&nbsp;year before his tragic passing, revealed his desire to&nbsp;be&nbsp;remembered not only as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor but as&nbsp;someone who “lived well, loved well, was a&nbsp;seeker,” and above all, as&nbsp;someone who wanted to&nbsp;help people. Perry’s profound wish to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;the lives of&nbsp;others demonstrates the depth of&nbsp;his character beyond his on-screen persona.</p><p>The loss of&nbsp;Matthew Perry is&nbsp;<a href=#>deeply felt</a> by&nbsp;his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, friends, and fans around the world. Perry’s wish to&nbsp;be&nbsp;remembered for his compassion and his <a href=#>desire to&nbsp;help people</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;person he&nbsp;was. While he&nbsp;may be&nbsp;remembered for his iconic role in&nbsp;<i>Friends</i>, it’s his spirit of&nbsp;benevolence and friendship that will forever be&nbsp;cherished by&nbsp;those who knew and loved him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLawusRmqqSxlWLAqa3RnqpmrJiaeq2t0q1koZ2Rp8GnscutZKado6iuqLHSZpmerKeasq95x56pZpmemXqurdOtn56vXaWys77YZm9qbmJmhHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./climat-apaise-et-premiers-amendements-au-senat-sur-le-projet-de-loi-vieillissement.html><span>←</span><span>Climat apais et premiers amendements au Snat sur le projet de loi Vieillissement</span></a>
