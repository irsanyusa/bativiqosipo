In his youth, he traveled to Italy, where he worked as a mercenary and later for a Florentine banker. Upon returning to England, he married Elizabeth Wyckes, with whom he had three children.</p><p>Cromwell's rise to power began in the 1520s when he became a trusted advisor to Cardinal Wolsey. After Wolsey's fall in 1529, Cromwell gained the favor of King Henry VIII and became his chief minister. He supported the king's efforts to annul his marriage to <a href=#>Catherine of Aragon</a> and break with the Catholic Church, which led to the English Reformation. Cromwell also played a key role in the dissolution of the monasteries.</p><p>Cromwell's downfall began when he arranged Henry VIII's marriage to <a href=#>Anne of Cleves</a> in 1540, which proved to be a disaster. The king found Anne unattractive, and the marriage was never consummated. Cromwell's enemies at court used this opportunity to turn the king against him, leading to his arrest on charges of treason and heresy.</p><p>Despite his pleas for mercy, Cromwell was subsequently executed on Tower Hill.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>c. 1485</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Putney, England</p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>July 28</a>, <a href=#>1540</a><br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Execution</a> by <a href=#>beheading</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Articles and Photos</h2><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/anne-of-cleeves-thomas-cromwell-sml.jpg width=270 height=225 alt="Thomas Cromwell Backs The Wrong Horse" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Thomas Cromwell Backs The Wrong Horse</h3><span class=linked_text>Thomas Cromwell became chief advisor to King Henry VIII and led the hunt for a new royal wife.
