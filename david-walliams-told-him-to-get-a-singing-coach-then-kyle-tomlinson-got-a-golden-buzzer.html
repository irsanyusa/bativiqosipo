But during his audition, he was noticeably nervous to be on the stage. Even though the judges didn’t remember it, Kyle had auditioned in series 8, so returning to perform was no easy task.</strong></p><p>This singer had a dream and wasn’t going to let David Walliams’s negative response turn him away. During Kyle’s series 11 audition, he recalled that Walliams had told him to get a singing teacher at only 12 years old.</p><p>During his 2017 audition, he stated that he was coming back to the series with three years of professional singing lessons. Kyle performed ‘Hallelujah’ by Leonard Cohen and received a golden buzzer from Walliams. Kyle made it all of the way to the finale in series 11 of BGT. He won sixth place in the series, but his audition has definitely not been forgotten in time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>bv</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-kyle-tomlinson-up-to-now>What is Kyle Tomlinson Up to Now?</h2><p>To this day, Kyle continues to pursue music professionally. His Linkedin page shares that he is theatrically trained with the London College of Music with distinctions and is always open to a new opportunity or challenge. This singer now has 15,000 subscribers on his YouTube. He primarily posts his music, along with an occasional <a href=#>reaction video</a> and <a href=#>vlog</a>. On top of YouTube, Kyle is also active on both Instagram and TikTok. Within both platforms Kyle shares his music and certain aspects of his personal life. He is currently in a relationship with model Amy Hoyle. The singers public relationship can be seen in both Instagram photos and <a href=#>adorable TikTok videos</a>.</p><p>Since his time on Britain’s Got Talent, Kyle released an independent album labeled Kyle Tomlinson. This five track album featured covers of songs written by Ed Sheeran, Christina Perri, Frank Wildhorn, and others.</p><p>Other than posting covers and performing for large corporate events in different countries, Kyle has not released any new music in a few years. Fans of his should be expected to see new music out of this artist very soon. Recently, he announced that he has new music in the works for the upcoming year.</p><p>“The cat is out of the bag! January 23rd i will be back in the studio making my next album,” Kyle wrote on Instagram. “I want to say a huge thank you to everyone who’s supported me over the years and a special thank you to Mourning Joy who are helping me with so many upcoming projects, this is only the beginning.”</p><p>This singer was known for his redemption and beautiful voice on Britain’s Got Talent, so I can’t wait to see what he has planned for his next album.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1357080597.jpg alt="‘America’s Got Talent’ Winner Bianca Ryan Is Starting Her Own Podcast" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdrK6tuMiapKxlpKS5pXnHoqRmrJ9itKbAjJpkrKGenLavs4ycppqbmGLBqbHNZqKypJViwbC5y6KlrKeeYrSwwIyaZKCnnJmyr3nBrrGznaJk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-people-shared-stories-about-the-worst-gifts-theyve-ever-gotten-799996.html><span>←</span><span>20+ People Shared Stories About the Worst Gifts Theyve Ever Gotten</span></a>
