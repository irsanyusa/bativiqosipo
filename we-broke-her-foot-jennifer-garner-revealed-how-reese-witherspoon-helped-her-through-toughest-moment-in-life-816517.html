I&nbsp;think back to&nbsp;going through a&nbsp;very public, very hard moment in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. She was right there, and the way&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;get through it&nbsp;was dance cardio.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<i>13 Going on&nbsp;30</i>&nbsp;actress didn’t specify the tough situation she was talking about, but she did talk about her and Witherspoon’s experiences with a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;athletic dance. She said how dance served as&nbsp;both a&nbsp;coping mechanism and a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bonding</a> experience for her and Witherspoon.</p><p><h2>Reese “broke her foot.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a6/1e0/0efe9159a5a9a6d6231277128c.jpg><p>Jennifer revealed that on&nbsp;that particular day, they danced so&nbsp;energetically that Reese ended up&nbsp;breaking her foot.</p><p>“And I&nbsp;danced cardio-d so&nbsp;hard, we&nbsp;broke her foot, but she kept going!” she said. “It&nbsp;was like, okay, we&nbsp;worked out at&nbsp;seven on&nbsp;vacation, we’re going to&nbsp;work out again at&nbsp;two. She was like, ’I’m going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there. I’m going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there.’”</p><p><h2>They adore each other.</h2></p><p>Unlike some Hollywood relationships that may seem artificial, the friendship between Garner and Witherspoon is&nbsp;genuine. They’ve known each other for decades, though the details of&nbsp;their first meeting remain unspecified. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent interview, Garner fondly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> how she was in&nbsp;awe of&nbsp;Witherspoon from the very beginning. “She seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;five steps ahead always, and she’s younger than I&nbsp;am, so&nbsp;you just feel like how do&nbsp;you know all of&nbsp;this,” the mom of&nbsp;three said.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, Garner shared that she’s kept and still uses gifts from Witherspoon over the years, including a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;bowls. It’s unclear whether these were housewarming or&nbsp;birthday presents. Garner has also reciprocated, giving Witherspoon a&nbsp;bowl she made herself for her birthday last year.</p><p>Jennifer Garner and Reese Witherspoon’s lasting friendship shines authentically, defying the industry’s transient nature. Similarly, there are other pairs of&nbsp;celebrities whose <a href=#>friendships</a> have remained strong over time, weathering the storms of&nbsp;fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSmecGrpqSdXZ2ys3nFqKatZZqau6%2B1xZ6pZp%2BRp7umvoyrnK%2BdkaGypXnHqK5mqpWawKZ51qKroZ2iqL2wu81mn56koJqxbrTEq2StoKKkwqi0jK2mrp%2BYmsC1ecyopJ6mpGK2r3nLop2eZWhmg3Z9lmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./my-wife-opened-my-eyes-on-how-my-parents-have-always-mistreated-me-now-they-hate-us-both-818484.html><span>←</span><span>My Wife Opened My Eyes on How My Parents Have Always Mistreated Me, Now They Hate Us Both</span></a>
