The “Stranger Things” star was asked by a reporter if she has experienced anti-Semitism in the industry, and she responded with several examples.</p><p>“I have … in interesting ways,” she explained. “There are times when people have said, ‘Wait, you’re Jewish? But you’re so pretty!’ There was a movie that I was up for a long time ago, it was a period piece, and the studio head, who was Jewish, said I looked ‘too Jewish’ to be in a blue-blooded family.”</p><p>She also recounted a disturbing run-in with Mel Gibson, which is a story <a href=# rel=nofollow>she has told over the years</a>.</p><p>“We were at a crowded party with one of my good friends,” she said. “And Mel Gibson was smoking a cigar, and we’re all talking and he said to my friend, who’s gay, ‘Oh wait, am I gonna get AIDS?’ And then something came up about Jews, and he said, ‘You’re not an oven dodger, are you?’”</p><p>Ryder says Gibson “tried” to apologize later on.</p><p>A spokesman for Gibson did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p><p>Gibson’s most famous anti-Semitic outburst took place in 2006, when a police report revealed that he said “The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world!” during a DUI arrest.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=noopener>told Variety</a> in 2016 that, “It was an unfortunate incident. I was loaded and angry and arrested. I was recorded illegally by an unscrupulous police officer who was never prosecuted for that crime. And then it was made public by him for profit, and by members of — we’ll call it the press. So, not fair. I guess as who I am, I’m not allowed to have a nervous breakdown, ever.”</p><p>Gibson’s prejudices have been publicly exposed several times. In 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">RadarOnline published audio recordings</a> of Gibson screaming at his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva during which he used racist slurs, including the n-word. The erratic Gibson — an A-list actor and director throughout the ’80s, ’90s and early 2000s — never fully recovered his stature from the fallout, though his 2016 war film “Hacksaw Ridge” was nominated for six Oscars, including best picture and best director for Gibson.</p><p>Ryder, who recently starred in “The Plot Against America,” said in the interview that she is “not religious, but I do identify. It’s a hard thing for me to talk about because I had family who died in the camps, so I’ve always been fascinated with that time.”</p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-flex lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-flex-wrap-wrap lrv-u-justify-content-center" aria-labelledby><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Mel Gibson,</a></li><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Winona Ryder</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXN8jp%2BgpaVfo7K4v46woKennpZ6s8XDnqlmpZWheqi1waymp2Wfq7KvecOom6CdomJ%2Bc3%2BTb2tvamhtfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rendez-vous-des-droits-objectif-largement-depasse-pour-les-caf.html><span>←</span><span>objectif largement dpass pour les CAF</span></a>
