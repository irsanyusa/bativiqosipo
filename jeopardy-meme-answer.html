Sometimes, it’s just the response that will get you the most respect — by way of humor.

So he took a risk and answered “What is you doing, baby?” a catchphrase that <a href=# rel=noopener>became Internet-famous</a> in 2017 and has remained a popular meme ever since.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He may have lost that round with his bet on humor instead of factual accuracy, but he won the admiration of viewers tuned in to Internet culture and memes. And over the course of his two days on the game show, he also <a href=# rel=noopener>won an accumulated</a> $40,001. Sounds like he knows exactly what he’s doing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubGNmhnd9jqOcqKiRp7G6ecyepJ5lkaPAuLHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-hudson-appears-in-new-promo-for-her-upcoming-talk-show.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Hudson Appears in New Promo for Her Upcoming Talk Show</span></a>
