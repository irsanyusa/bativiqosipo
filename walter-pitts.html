 Biography: Walter Pitts was an American logician, mathematician, and cognitive scientist who made significant contributions to the early development of artificial intelligence and the understanding of neural networks. He is best known for his collaboration with Warren McCulloch, with whom he co-authored a seminal paper titled &#34;A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&#34; (1943).
In this influential paper, Pitts and McCulloch developed a mathematical model of neural networks, known as the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, which demonstrated how simple networks of interconnected neurons could perform complex logical operations."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
