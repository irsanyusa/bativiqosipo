The success of the talented duo extended beyond national borders when they received an invitation to compete on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a>.</p><p>The duo’s resilience and dedication drove them to participate in spin off competition, Spain’s Got Talent: All-Stars. The recent final episode of Spain’s Got Talent: All-Stars brought together the top 12 artists who had qualified throughout the various rounds. Ultimately, Stefanny and Yeeremy’s exceptional talent and dedication paid off as they claimed the ultimate title.</p><p>The dancers not only won the 25,000 euro prize but also managed to get Risto Mejide, one of the judges, on his feet and dancing alongside them. Vardanyan Brothers secured the second position, while B-Unique finished third in the intense competition.</p><p>Stefanny and Yeeremy’s triumph as the winners of Spain’s Got Talent: All-Stars marks a significant milestone in their journey to success.

Despite the immense talent on display, Spain’s Got Talent: All-Stars faced tough competition and experienced mixed results in terms of viewership.</p><p>Throughout the first season of Spain’s Got Talent: All-Stars, the show consistently attracted an average of around one million viewers each night, which, considering Telecinco’s usual viewership numbers, can be deemed acceptable. However, it faced stiff competition from its main rival, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">La Voz Kids</a>, which aired on Saturdays as well.</p><p>Approximately 1.15 million viewers watched the final episode of Spain’s Got Talent: All-Stars, which garnered an 11.2% share. While these numbers may seem significant, they fell short compared to the previous episode and were considerably lower. Additionally, the show failed to secure the top spot for the night, as it was surpassed by competing programs like Mulán on Cuatro and La Voz Kids on Antena 3.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_EuerkaOHara_LandonCider_Symone_SashaColby-220x147.jpg alt="Maren Morris, Drag Stars Express Extreme Disapproval of Anti-LGBTQ+ Legislation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xaippp2iYq6owIydmKebmaO0brDUqGSsrJWbrq%2B62GaYp5xdrrKmvsSmsGavmaN6tLzAoqWsZZekwW7AwKWcp6xdlrmtedKtmKurXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./armement-des-polices-municipales-les-prefets-recadres.html><span>←</span><span>Armement des polices municipales : les prfets recadrs</span></a>
