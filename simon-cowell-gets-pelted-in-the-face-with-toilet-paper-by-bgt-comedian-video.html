He did the unthinkable to Simon Cowell when he pelted him in the face with a load of toilet paper. You need to see this act for yourself down below.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-marty-putz-pelted-simon-cowell-in-the-face-on-bgt>Marty Putz Pelted Simon Cowell In The Face On ‘BGT’</h2><p>Marty started off the routine holding up a barbell with weights on it. He covered his hands with a prop that made it look like he was actually lifting the weights. It was all just an illusion. The crowd began laughing hysterically. He then grabbed an iron and pretended to iron his face. When he removed the iron, a fake nose and mouth prosthetic appeared on his face.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WATCH BIZARRE BURPING ACT GET BUZZED OFF OF THE ‘BGT’ STAGE</a></strong></p><p>When he said that he trained a flea to do a cannonball, he pulled out a contraption to demonstrate this. Alesha Dixon did not find it amusing and hit her red buzzer. Marty realized that some of the water splashed onto Simon but promised he would dry it up. He pulled out another machine and this time pressed a button that released toilet paper. The toilet paper flew through the air and pelted Simon in the face. At the end of the act, Simon’s entire face was covered with toilet paper.</p><p>Alesha said that if she knew Marty was going to hit Simon with toilet paper then she never would have buzzed the act. “That is the funniest thing I think I have ever seen in my life,” David Walliams said through a fit of giggles. Simon sat humiliated with the toilet paper covering his whole face. Check out the compilation below of 10 of the most humiliating acts that totally embarrassed Simon.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-his-semi-finals-performance-was-a-disaster>His Semi-Finals Performance Was A Disaster</h3><p>Marty performed an outer space-inspired routine for the ‘BGT’ Semi-Finals. He actually ended up stripping down to his underwear after mocking a spaceship launch. When he turned around, there was a hole in his boxers that exposed his butt. After trying to get the judges and the audience to throw marshmallows inside of his mouth, Simon and Alesha hit their red buzzers. Marshmallows began flying around the entire theater in this chaotic routine.</p><p>Marty then unveiled another machine. This time, it shot out a mysterious liquid on the judges and the audience. Amanda Holden was clearly disgusted and hit her red buzzer. Amanda and Alesha got up from the judge’s table before Marty could bust out his toilet paper machines. Dec ran out from backstage and held up a second toilet paper machine. He pelted both Simon and David in the face with toilet paper. David hit his red buzzer which shut down the act. He was eliminated from the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzQ8M6cp618</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-marty-putz-now>Where Is Marty Putz Now?</h3><p>Though he got four red buzzers during his ‘BGT’ performance, Marty posted an Instagram video saying it was “one of the most amazing moments of my life.” He also laughed about soaking the judges.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BjdH2rml36X/</p></figure><p>Marty hasn’t posted anything on Instagram or Twitter for the past two years. He did update his Facebook page in 2020 to announce that his screenplay called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Switched At Death</a> became an official selection for The Atlanta Comedy Film Festival.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>THIS WOMAN WHO THRE EGGS AT SIMON COWELL ON LIVE TV &nbsp;— WHY DID SHE DO IT?</a></strong></p><p>Marty’s journey on ‘BGT’ ended rather abruptly but at least he got to pelt Simon in the face with toilet paper before getting buzzed off the stage. This is something a lot of past contestants would probably want to do.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/DJ-Murray-Mint-Simon-Cowell-BGT-Simon-Cowell-Dancing.jpeg alt="Simon Cowell Does Most Awkward Dance EVER During This ‘BGT’ Act [VIDEO]" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKCdpKh6sbHLrZydZZmjerW0xGadmpuVYsSqwMdmq6ihnJrBbrzAqZyrZZKueqOz02aaqKWVmbaiuoyvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shaq-documentary-hbo.html><span>←</span><span>Shaquille O'Neal Opens up in New HBO Documentary</span></a>
