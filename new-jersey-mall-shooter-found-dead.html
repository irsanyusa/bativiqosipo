Bergen County, N.J. prosecutor John Molinelli&nbsp;<a href=#>told CNN</a> that it appears Shoop shot himself. Molinelli also said that Shoop had a history of drug abuse.</p><p>The chaos started just before 9:30 p.m. at New Jersey’s largest shopping mall, when police say Shoop walked into the mall dressed in all black and wearing a motorcycle helmet. According to witnesses, Shoop worked his way through the mall, shooting security cameras and firing off about half a dozen shots in all.</p><p>The mall was put on lockdown as shoppers and workers scrambled for exits. Shoop then headed to an area of the mall that’s difficult to access and shot himself. No one was injured in the shooting.</p><p>[<a href=#>CNN</a>]</p><h3>Lockdown Chaos at New Jersey's Largest Mall</h3>Tyson Trish / APPolice officers stand outside the Garden State Plaza Mall where multiple shots were fired inside the mall shortly before closing time, on Nov. 4, 2013, in Paramus, N.J.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkam2sLqNraCmnV6YvK57kWlobGdhZnxxgY6nnLBlmpq%2FtLHYZqSapJxiwKm7zq2cq2WWpMKvsIydnJqcXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dans-lorne-le-medicobus-rencontre-les-habitants-sans-medecin-traitant-61.html><span>←</span><span>Les Ornais sans mdecin sont reus dans le Mdicobus (61)</span></a>
