<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>University of West Bohemia - Czech Universities</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Additional information</h2><h3>Study in the Heart of Europe</h3><p>We are based in Pilsen – a city of industry and beer. The Škoda company, with its traditional production of vehicles for urban and rail transport and power engineering devices that gave rise to our technical disciplines, and Pilsner Urquell, one of the world’s top brewing companies, have become an integral part of the life of our city and the University.</p><p>You can enjoy travelling not only around the Republic (Prague is approximately 90 minutes from Pilsen), but also visit lots of other European cities.</p><h3>Research & Development at UWB</h3><p>The University is a leading centre for <a href=#>research and development</a>, as evidenced by massive investments into its growth and advancement. In addition to quality education, we are proud of the excellent results in basic and applied research carried out in our modern research centres. Our greatest asset is a multidisciplinary approach, which has earned us an important position among universities both in the Czech Republic and in Europe.</p><h3>Libraries</h3><p>The UWB offers five specialized research&nbsp;<a href=#>libraries</a> and study rooms (classic, individual and team ones). You can profit from a wide range of loan and other services, e-resources that include e-journals, e-books, and databases.</p><h3>Accommodation and Meals</h3><p>Accommodation is available for all international students at the University’s own halls of residence. Prices vary depending on the room type: single/double/triple bedrooms. All halls of residence have fitted kitchens with facilities for self-catering. Students can take advantage of the University canteen offer.</p><h3>Student Life</h3><p>The University has a number of student clubs and organizations that are actively involved in the everyday running of the University. They also organize various cultural events and help students spend their free time and prepare them for their future professional life.</p><h3>City of Pilsen</h3><p>When you decide to study at the University of West Bohemia,&nbsp;<a href=#>Pilsen</a> - the fourth largest city in the Czech Republic – will become your home. The city represents at the same time an important industrial, commercial, cultural, and administrative centre of West Bohemia. Pilsen offers a refreshing mixture of cultural, sport and public activities, and the city received the title of “Cultural Capital of Europe” in 2015.</p><p>The cost of living is lower than in Prague or other cities in Western Europe; therefore, the living expenses are quite moderate. There are a lot of international students and businesses in Pilsen, which makes it a friendly and open city to live, study and work in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Kaq5qkn5zCpnnOn2SuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtfqruqwsSrqqKsqWK8p3nWnqqtZZKktaa5yJpkoqZdpbatv8Sn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eolien-une-circulaire-tire-les-consequences-de-la-soumission-au-regime-des-icpe.html><span>←</span><span>une circulaire tire les consquences de la soumission au rgime des ICPE</span></a>
