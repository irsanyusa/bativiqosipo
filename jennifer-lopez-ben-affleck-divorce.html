The pair became known, even before such power-couple portmanteaus were ubiquitous, as “Bennifer.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Court records showed Lopez filed the petition Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The news was first reported by the TMZ website. TMZ reported further that Lopez listed the date of separation as April 26, 2024. It added that she did not mention any prenuptial agreement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After meeting, falling in love and getting engaged in the early 2000s—and starring together in 2003’s infamous Gigli and 2004’s Jersey Girl—the couple parted ways, blaming in part the pressure of the public eye.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But to the delight of many and perhaps the skepticism of others, they reunited two decades later and married—twice—in 2022.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>A Comprehensive Timeline of Bennifer, Perhaps the Greatest Love Story of Our Time</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient,” wrote Lopez, announcing their first, quickie Las Vegas wedding that July, and signing off as Jennifer Lynn Affleck.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Stick around long enough and maybe you’ll find the best moment of your life in a drive through in Las Vegas at 12:30 in the morning in the tunnel of love drive through with your kids and the one you’ll spend forever with,” she wrote in her newsletter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The couple had flown to Las Vegas, lined up with their license with four other couples and were wed just after midnight at A Little White Wedding Chapel, where Lopez said a Bluetooth speaker played their brief march down the aisle. She called it the best night of the couple’s lives.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A month later, they had a much grander wedding at Affleck’s house in Georgia, in front of friends and family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Both of them had been previously married. Affleck, 52, married Jennifer Garner, with whom he shares three children, in 2005. They divorced in 2018.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lopez, 55, had been married three times before. She was briefly married to Ojani Noa from 1997–1998 and to Cris Judd from 2001–2003. She and singer Marc Anthony were married for a decade, having wed in 2004, and share 14-year-old twins. She started dating former baseball player Alex Rodriguez in 2017, but the couple called off their engagement in 2021.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All along, it had been Lopez who was more vocal in describing her and Affleck’s journey. When asked earlier this year whether she was harder on herself because her relationships had been so high-profile, Lopez agreed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Oh yeah. 100%. It’s made me doubt myself and really feel bad about myself at times. Made me feel like I wanted to quit at times. But at the end of the day, I feel like you kind of have to do this thing where you learn how to navigate it,” she told the Associated Press. “You take the things that could be constructive about that and use it, and the rest you kind of just throw away as kind of like haterations or, you know, other things like that and just be like, ‘Whatever. I know who I am, I know what I want to do.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Affleck himself expressed admiration for her self-possession, telling the AP last year that he agreed with the idea that Hollywood was unsure how to capitalize on her wide-ranging talent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I think she’s in her prime,” Affleck said then. “She’s doing extraordinary work in large measure because she’s taking that step to take responsibility for what she’s doing rather than say, ‘This is what I’m being offered.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>The 16 Best J. Lo Movies Of All Time</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lopez is starring in the upcoming Unstoppable, under <a href=#>Affleck and Matt Damon</a>’s Artists Equity banner.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In May, she starred in the Netflix movie Atlas. At the end of the month, she suddenly canceled her 2024 North American tour, saying she was “heartsick and devastated” to be letting fans down but the move was necessary. “Jennifer is taking time off to be with her children, family and close friends,” organizers said in a statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The tour was to be her first in five years, in support of her first solo album in a decade, This Is Me.... Now and its <a href=#>companion film</a>. a fictionalized look at her long love life, and a documentary.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When I was a girl they’d ask me what I’d be. A woman in love is what I grew up wantin’ to be,” Lopez sang on the title track.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The album, she said, was inspired by her rekindled relationship with Affleck. But the film was more “about your journey as a person, it’s about one person’s journey and what it takes to get from heartbreak back to love. Or a hopeless romantic’s journey in their search for love.” In the movie, she played a character called The Artist who, similarly, had decided as a child what she wanted to be when she grew up: “in love.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the road was rocky. In an early scene, The Artist is on the back of a motorcycle, riding across a beach, with a hunky man, face shielded. Then the motorcycle crashes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Not all love stories have a happy ending,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—Noveck reported from New York.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGFofXd8jqOcp6aZm7Kzecuop56yXZeyr3nAn52lnZOgeqW11aipnJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./groupes-dentraide-mutuelle-le-dispositif-est-stabilise.html><span>←</span><span>Groupes d'entraide mutuelle : le dispositif est stabilis</span></a>
