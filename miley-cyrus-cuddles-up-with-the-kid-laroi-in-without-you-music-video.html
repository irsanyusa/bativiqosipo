What could be better than food and friendship?</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-the-kid-laroi-team-up-for-without-you>Miley Cyrus, The Kid Laroi Team Up for ‘Without You’</h2><p>Cyrus and Laroi cuddle up together in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the video</a> by the fire. In an all-too-relatable moment, the former Disney star shoves a slice of pizza in her mouth as Laroi looks on. The pair also sit underneath a neon-lit tree in the video as they belt the tune that first went viral on TikTok this year.</p><p>The video for “Without You” is definitely trippy as the duo lean on a giant mushroom and embrace each other as their voices melt together. Laroi sings underneath purple neon lights before Cyrus showers him with a handful of french fries.</p><p>We still can’t decide if this all feels like a fever dream or a wild night out at a rave. Regardless, it’s a fun new take on the song which was originally a powerful breakup anthem. Now, we get to see the other side of it with a budding friendship.</p><p>They stand on top of a truck parked in front of a McDonald’s and we are all so confused yet so intrigued at the same time. Fans got some major bestie vibes from Cyrus and Laroi who sound perfect singing together and also chowed down on some greasy and delicious food.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-collaboration-is-the-start-of-a-new-friendship-between-the-duo>This Collaboration is the Start of a New Friendship Between the Duo</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‘WITHOUT YOU’ with <a href=#>@thekidlaroi</a> is out now 🖤</p><p>LOVE this song as much as I loooooove my new friend!</p><p>We made this video on a random week night! Hit the kid at 12 am he said “I’ll be there in an hour” and he was. This is what we made! 🍄 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/AJF920xjCR</a></p>— Miley Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) <a href=#>April 30, 2021</a></figure><p>“Just imagine how Laroi’s feeling right now. We all grew up watching Miley as ‘Hannah,’ Now he gets to have a song with her as a feature on it. Has to be mind-blowing for him,” one fan wrote in the comments section of the music video.</p><p>Cyrus starred in Disney’s Hannah Montana for four seasons, establishing herself as a singer and actress that could literally do anything. We have seen Cyrus <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>grow up over the years</a> and truly find <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>her own unique style</a> and sound, one that Laroi became a fan of. At just 17 years old, the opportunity to collaborate with her will open up so many doors for him. The Australian singer is already a favorite amongst the social media generation.</p><p>“Why does Miley’s voice go so well with everyoneeee she collabs with omg,” one person pointed out.</p><p>Cyrus has collaborated with some of the world’s biggest artists like Dua Lipa and Stevie Nicks. Versatility is something she excels at and singing with Laroi is no different.</p><p>“We made this video on a random week night! Hit the kid at 12 am he said “I’ll be there in an hour” and he was. This is what we made!” Cyrus wrote on Twitter.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MILEY CYRUS WINS WEBBY SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD FOR HER SHOW ‘BRIGHT MINDED’</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Nick-Jonas.jpeg alt="Nick Jonas Hilariously Reacts to Hosting the Billboard Music Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>miley cyrus</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zKKjnrFdmMazwdJmmq6clKGytHnUqWSwoaSderW0xGaiopxdoa6zu8hmoKdlp57BqbvUrWSyp6Viura%2FyJxkr6GUmrxw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./masked-singer-who-is-the-kangaroo.html><span>←</span><span>Jordin Sparks?
