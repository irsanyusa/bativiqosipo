Pickleball was created in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Wash., by politician Joel Pritchard and his friends Barney McCallum and Bill Bell as a backyard game to entertain their children. By 1976, it had gone from an off-the-cuff leisure-time invention to a sport with an official tournament, with<a href=# rel=noopener> a competition held at the South Center Athletic Club in Tukwila, Wash.</a> And by 1990, pickleball was being played in all 50 states. The sport was always a favorite on the senior-citizen circuit as a form of low-impact exercise, but it has seen <a href=# rel=noopener>a surge in popularity</a> in recent years, thanks in part to a demand for safe and social distance-friendly recreation during the pandemic. A <a href=# rel=noopener>2022 report</a> from the U.S.A. Pickleball Association found that the number of people playing jumped nearly 40% from 2019 to 2021.</p><p><b>Read more: </b><a href=# rel=noopener><i>Why Older People Love Pickleball So Much</i></a></p><p>The mainstream rise of pickleball can’t be overstated. <a href=# rel=noopener>NBA players LeBron James, Draymond Green, and Kevin Love have all invested in </a>Major League Pickleball.
