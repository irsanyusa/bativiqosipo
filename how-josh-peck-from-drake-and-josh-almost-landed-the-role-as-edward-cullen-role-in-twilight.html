His candid conversation has added an intriguing layer to the casting process, that ultimately led to the Twilight we know and love today. Ironically, Peck shared this all with none other than Twilight star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Lautner</a>.</p><p>“It’s like 2006? 7? They’re like, ‘Audition for this movie, Twilight, it’s based on a book, it’s going to be great,'” Peck said. “So I send in my tape, for Edward. A month later, I’m with my manager, he goes, ‘It’s down to you and three guys, you’re close.'”</p><a title=@dearmedia href=# rel=noopener>@dearmedia</a> We need to see that audition tape <a title=edwardcullen href=# rel=noopener>#edwardcullen</a> <a title=twilight href=# rel=noopener>#twilight</a> <a title=twilightaudition href=# rel=noopener>#twilightaudition</a> <a title=taylorlautner href=# rel=noopener>#taylorlautner</a> <a title=goodguyspodcast href=# rel=noopener>#goodguyspodcast</a> <a title=podcastclips href=# rel=noopener>#podcastclips</a> <a title="♬ original sound - Dear Media" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – Dear Media</a><p>“I’m like, ‘Really?’ I hadn’t even had a tummy tuck yet, I’m like, ‘There’s no way. He’s got to be so shirtless, it’s not going to happen.’ Spoiler alert—didn’t get it.” Peck said.</p><p>Reflecting on the near-miss, Peck expressed his disbelief at how close he had come to landing the role. He went on to humorously question the decisions that were made in the end.</p><p>Lautner, clearly taken aback by this, couldn’t help but express his amazement, “Did I know this? That’s amazing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-josh-peck-shares-a-parody-of-twilight-s-official-poster-featuring-him-as-edward-cullen>Josh Peck Shares a Parody of Twilight’s Official Poster Featuring Him as Edward Cullen</h2><p>The former Nickelodeon star decided to take a playful jab at the iconic series before the podcast episode aired. In a recent social media post, Peck shared a hilarious parody of the official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twilight</a> movie poster, replacing the original trio of Edward, Jacob, and Bella with himself, Lautner, and his co-host Ben Soffer.</p><p>The parody poster replicates the moody atmosphere of the original. It features Peck as Edward Cullen, Lautner as Jacob Black, and Soffer humorously taking on the role of Bella Swan. In a cheeky twist, Soffer is seen tightly holding onto Lautner, mimicking Bella’s signature pose in the original artwork. The post was an instant hit among fans who couldn’t help but appreciate the trio’s playful nod to the vampire saga.</p><p>Adding to the humor, Lautner couldn’t resist chiming in on the post. Lautner’s comment, “Ben, you’ll always be my Bella,” brought even more joy to fans and showcased the camaraderie and good-natured humor shared between the “Great Guys” hosts.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_DeadlyGames_Gabe-GinsbergGetty-Images-220x143.jpg alt="Why Wasn’t Deadly Games a Nominee for ‘AGT: Fantasy League?’ Did Alfredo Silva, Aleksandra Kiedrowicz Break Up?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x6iuZqKfqLVuvMScomaeoqS6brDRmqKeZZGjsW62zqyfZpmcory0wIylmKeclZl6tbTEZqmopJVirrR5xJ2umqqUYrC2uMuepWaqn6GybrXNZquwoZyetKnAjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5g-de-la-difficulte-dattribuer-des-frequences-sans-connaitre-les-usages.html><span>←</span><span>de la difficult dattribuer des frquences sans connatre les usages</span></a>
