Centering on the experiences of Trelawny, the nerdy but lovable son of two Jamaican immigrants who moved to Miami after rising political violence in Kingston forced them to vacate, the stories explore the challenges that he and his family face as they attempt to square two vastly different cultures and survive disasters both natural, like Hurricane Andrew, and man-made, including the 2008 recession and capitalism at large.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy now</b>: <i>If I Survive You </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong><i>The Marriage Portrait, </i>Maggie O’Farrell (Sept. 6)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/The-marriage-portrait.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Little is known about Lucrezia de’Medici, the noblewoman who died at the age of 16 in 1561, but her mysterious death, rumored to be caused by poisoning at the hand of her husband, allegedly inspired the poet Robert Browning to write the foreboding monologue, “My Last Duchess.” In <i>The Marriage Portrait</i>, <a href=#>Maggie O’Farrell</a>, author of the celebrated 2020 novel <i>Hamnet,</i> takes her own swing at Lucrezia’s story. She sets aside the young woman’s imminent death, instead focusing on imagining a rich interior life for the duchess that highlights the tragic contrast between her big hopes and dreams and the stark limitations of her time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy now</b>: <i>The Marriage Portrait </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>On the Rooftop</i></b><b>, Margaret Wilkerson Sexton (Sept. 6)</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/On-the-rooftop.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s the 1950s in <a href=#>gentrifying San Francisco</a>, and widower Vivan’s three daughters are aspiring musicians who perform at local bars and nightclubs. She wants them to make it big—but as the girls turn into women, they begin pursuing paths that will lead them away from music and their mother’s dreams. The family unit begins to splinter in parallel with their historically Black neighborhood. <i>On the Rooftop</i> jumps between four narrators—Vivian and each of her daughters—and beautifully captures the complicated emotions that arise when a parent realizes that what she wants for her kids doesn’t necessarily align with what they need.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now:</b> <i>On the Rooftop </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>People Person</i></b><b>, Candice Carty-Williams (Sept. 13)</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/People-person.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dimple Pennington didn’t exactly hit the jackpot in the family department—she barely knows her four half-siblings, and her absent father is a people person who enjoys fraternizing with everyone but his own kids. But when she lands in a sticky situation that could lead directly to prison, help comes from a surprising, familial place. As Dimple and her siblings band together, they get to know each other for the first time as adults and begin to come to terms with the role their father might, or might not, play in their lives. The novel—Candice Carty-Williams’ second, after her acclaimed <a href=#>2019 debut </a><a href=#><i>Queenie</i></a>—is a big-hearted reminder that a messy family is still a family.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now:</b> <i>People Person </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong><i>Woman Without Shame, </i>Sandra Cisneros (Sept. 13)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Woman-without-shame.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sandra Cisneros returns with her first book of poetry in 28 years with <i>Woman Without Shame</i>, an electrifying collection of meditations on her life and work as an artist, paying tribute to her Mexican ancestors and the legacy she carries. The author, who made her writing debut in 1983 with <a href=#><i>The House on Mango Street</i></a>, looks back on both her personal and artistic experiences as a way of freeing herself for the future, revisiting past loves and family trauma while dissecting topics like politics and religion.

In <i>Revolution and Dictatorship</i>, <a href=#>Steven Levitsky</a> and Lucan Way argue that the counterrevolutionary conflict triggered by these violent uprisings leads to the kind of solidarity and state-building that allow authoritarianism to flourish. The nearly 700-page book is a clear and comprehensive analysis from the duo who previously authored <i>Competitive Authoritarianism: Hybrid Regimes After the Cold War</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now:</b> <i>Revolution and Dictatorship </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong><i>Bliss Montage, </i>Ling Ma (Sept. 13)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Bliss-montage-storiesLingMa.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ling Ma follows up her prescient and popular 2018 debut novel <i>Severance </i>with <i>Bliss Montage</i>, a collection of short stories that finds the fantastical within the mundane.

Despite their different upbringings and personalities, Fabienne and Agnés share a friendship that’s strengthened by their secret game, the writing of their own narratives. Their relationship is challenged when Agnés leaves for finishing school and, later, a stint in the publishing world. But when she learns of Fabienne’s unexpected death after nearly a decade of physical and emotional separation, it prompts her to tell the stories that they wrote in order to keep her friend’s memory alive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy now</b>: <i>The Book of Goose </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong><i>Lucy By the Sea, </i>Elizabeth Strout (Sept. 20)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/lucy-by-the-sea.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Pulitzer Prize-winning author <a href=#>Elizabeth Strout</a> revisits one of her most unforgettable characters, the titular heroine of <i>My Name Is Lucy Barton</i> and <i><a href=#>Oh William!</a>, </i>its sequel. <i>Lucy By the Sea</i> is another Barton installment that confronts the deep and familiar tangles of intimate relationships.

In her new novel, <i>Shrines of Gaiety</i>, she takes on London in the 1920s, masterfully capturing both its shimmer and its seediness. Atkinson introduces Nellie Coker, an ambitious nightclub owner with six children who’s just been released from prison. The narration shifts between an eccentric cast of characters, including Nellie, her kids, a detective determined to bring her down, two young runaways, and an unassuming librarian trying to unravel a mystery. It’s a deliciously fun, absorbing read.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy Now:</b> <i>Shrines of Gaiety </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong><i>Stay True, </i>Hua Hsu (Sept. 27)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Stay-True-HuaHsu.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Hua Hsu’s poignant new memoir, <i>Stay True</i>, a coming-of-age friendship provides the catalyst for clear-eyed recollections. Hsu describes how a friendship struck with Ken, a student whose preppy, stereotypically masculine interests were a far cry from his own counter-cultural tastes, became a deep kinship rooted in their exclusion from American culture. Though their backgrounds differed—Ken came from a long line of Japanese Americans, while Hsu is the child of Taiwanese immigrants—they found common ground. After Ken’s unexpected and violent death, Hsu kept his memory alive by writing. The result is this bittersweet memoir, a reflection on the power of friendship and how we can find connection in the most unexpected of places.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy now</b>: <i>Stay True </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Fen, Bog, & Swamp</i></b><b>, Annie Proulx (Sept. 27)</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FEn-Bog-and-Swamp.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Novelist Annie Proulx—author of the short story <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>, in addition to such titles as <i>The Shipping News</i> and <i>Barkskins</i>—has always written carefully and compellingly about the environment. In <i>Fen, Bog, & Swamp</i>, she turns her attention to peat-making wetlands. Proulx brings fens, bogs, swamps, and marine estuaries to life with detailed descriptions of their importance, their history, and how they’re now being exploited.

For 12-year-old Bird, countless questions swirl around his family’s complicated history. His mother, a Chinese American poet, left when he was 9 years old under murky circumstances after her work became a rallying cry for dissenters protesting the government’s Preserving American Culture and Traditions Act. In the years since, he’s learned to disavow both her name and her art.

Starting with his experiences as the young son of Jamaican immigrant parents in Ohio, Shakur details his struggles with familial homophobia and the aftermath of his father’s murder. In college, he finds community and political organizing that speak to his values, but realizes there is no easy answer to structural oppression in the U.S; his travels around the world both during and after college reveal to him that the prejudice he has experienced is not exclusively American, though his trips to Ferguson, Mo., where he protested for Black Lives Matter, and to the Dakotas, where he stood alongside activists at Standing Rock, were among his most meaningful. The story of Shakur’s life is a deeply personal reflection that celebrates self-discovery in the face of intergenerational trauma and a violent colonial legacy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Buy now</b>: <i>When They Tell You to Be Good </i>on <a href=# rel=noopener>Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel=noopener>Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Which Side Are You On</i></b><b>, Ryan Lee Wong (Oct. 4)</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/which-side-are-you-on.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Ryan Lee Wong’s debut novel, Reed, an Asian American college student, is ready to drop out to devote himself full-time to the Black Lives Matter movement.
