The cranky-looking <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grumpy Cat</a> and childlike <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Bub</a>, both of whom left us last year, are shining examples of this furry fascination.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The last year in particular has seen the debut of some viral cats of note. There are mischievous troublemakers and there are pets who just want more attention from their humans. (And, on more than one occasion, these cats get by with a little help from their friends.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here, TIME has ranked the best viral cats of the last year, on some very serious criteria: humor, skill, uniqueness and, in most cases, cuteness.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Please feel free to choose your fighter.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">10. Football Black Cat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/black-cat-giants-game.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It didn’t take a human’s Twitter thread to make this one go viral. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">black cat who interrupted a New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys game</a> on Nov. 4, 2019, found fame on his own by storming MetLife Stadium during the NFL game. A radio announcer for Westwood One took the potentially superstitious cat quite seriously. “Policemen and state troopers have come onto the field, and the cat runs into the end zone! That is a touchdown,” Kevin Harlan said. “And the cat is elusive, kind of like [Saquon] Barkley and [Ezekiel] Elliott!”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kevin Harlan's Westwood One radio call of the cat on the field is, as you might expect, an all-time great call. How much of a pro is Harlan? He worked a sponsor read into it. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3x0MVNEHNY</a></p>— Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog) <a href=#>November 5, 2019</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His athletic prowess and agility are unmatched.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">9. Betrayed Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A cat fight is expected from the first moment of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this viral video</a>. Shared by Twitter user @MerielMyers on Nov. 4, this small gray cat makes his feelings known as he watches his owners play with a new, blonde kitten. The jealousy is palpable.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The look of utter betrayal,” the tweet says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The video has 3.7 million views because how can you ignore this cat’s emotional needs? Naturally, many people began theorizing as to what the gray cat was thinking. One user suggested the cat was “calculating how they’re [going to] make it look like the orange cat ‘ran away.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jealousy is hard, but rather than engaging in a cat fight, this furry friend just watched in disbelief.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">8. Cat Fight</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the old adage goes, all is fair in love and war. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These two cool cats</a> certainly took that wisdom to heart in their own battle. YouTuber Laura Lee shared security footage that revealed her black cat pushing her other cat into the pool.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Upon further investigation, Lee discovered that the push was actually one of retaliation. Earlier, the spotted cat bit the black cat, spawning one of the most legendary cat fights in internet history. We can thank modern technology for the fact that Lee was able to capture both encounters on camera, but what happened between the cats behind the scenes remains a mystery.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">We can all take some inspiration from this premeditated power play.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">7. Jealous Halloween Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">People have long been dressing as cats for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween</a>. (Many of us are lazy, and putting on a black headband with cat ears is, well, extremely easy.) But it’s important to take into account how your pet may feel upon seeing you steal his or her look.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last Halloween, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one cat threw a proper kitty tantrum</a> because his owner not only had kitty ears on for the holiday, but also painted on some whiskers, ultimately stealing his look. “He looked really freaked out, and looked like he was going to pounce on me until I took the ears off. Then, he went back to normal as if nothing happened,” the owner told viral video licensing company ViralHog.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The cat’s anger was so serious that he lowered his ears, a sign of a feline’s frustration.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s safe to assume the owner learned her lesson.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">6. Tuna Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Just as a pet dog may salivate as his owner cooks up some beef, one cat caused quite a stir with her owner as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he dared to eat tuna</a> without her. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The cat owner,</a> voice actor Jesse Nowack, had a seriously intense experience when his cat, Khaleesi — aptly named after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Game of Thrones Mad Queen</a> — was rightfully upset after being denied the can of tuna in question.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was evidently not only the fishy scent that caused such a ruckus. This cat seems to feel intense emotions around any and all cans, assuming her own kitty food is being prepared. “I opened beans the other day,” Nowack wrote in the Twitter thread, “and then I let her smell it and the look of pure betrayal on her face cut me deep inside.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>She does this with ANY can. I opened beans the other day and she was SO pumped and then I let her smell it and the look of pure betrayal on her face cut me deep inside</p>— Jesse Nowack (@Nowacking) <a href=#>January 20, 2020</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though Khaleesi’s antics would imply she wants to eat some human food, Nowack says that she’s just hamming it up for the drama. “She’s a super picky eater and will only eat her wet and dry cat food, despite getting very excited about me opening any can in the house,” he told TIME in an email.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">5. Elf on the Shelf Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the holiday season, it’s nice to get creative. From putting up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanukkah bushes</a> to sewing your own matching pajamas, families are always innovating their traditions. Last Christmas, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one mom took her family’s Elf on the Shelf toys</a> to the next level by creating snow angels, using flour as the fake snow.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unfortunately, the display did not last 24 hours, as their pet cat had his own decorative plan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Twitter user Siarra Swanson told her mom’s Christmastime cat story in four parts, showing the unfortunate aftermath of a once-beautiful holiday display and the cat covered in flour. Some cats set their sights on desired food, but others, like this one, are more interested in wreaking general havoc.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">4. Cat with Dog Friends</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This cat</a> couldn’t have made it without two lovely dog friends at his or her side. In March, writer John Paul Brammer shared his wild night with the three animals on Twitter, after spotting two dogs and a cat outside his apartment door.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once the cat slipped by him, Brammer tweeted that he had to check his own video footage “for evidence.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The viral thread showed that Brammer was up against some serious “masterminds,” as he called them, as he couldn’t seem to keep them out of his apartment. They appeared to be opening doors all on their own.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Soon enough, it was revealed that the mysterious pets belonged to Brammer’s upstairs neighbors. But still, they wouldn’t be persuaded to head back home. “I would find one solution and then, the animals would overcome it,” Brammer told TIME in a previous interview.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some cats, when armed with two dog friends, just cannot be tamed.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">3. Quilty the Shelter Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Friends for Life Animal Rescue and Adoption Organization’s Houston location had a run for its money last fall with legendary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quilty the Shelter Cat</a>, a devoted animal who wouldn’t stop freeing himself and the other cats from their rooms. Somehow, Quilty is another animal with the magical ability to open doors all on his own. The shelter had a blast spreading the word on social media.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Quilty’s review with the parole board was denied, so he released himself of his own recognizance today. He felt that confinement had nothing more to offer him,” one shelter worker wrote in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a Facebook comment</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Twitter user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheDreamGhoul</a> also shared the wild story, begging anyone to “adopt this criminal cat.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other cat adoption centers got involved in Quilty’s case online, with the Nebraska Humane Society’s cat-focused Twitter page asserting that Quilty is innocent.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">2. Cinderblock the Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cinderblock the Cat</a> may not be the most famous gal of all the aforementioned legendary cats, but she might just be the most relatable. Cinderblock has been on a weight loss journey with her doctors at Northshore Veterinary Hospital in Bellingham, Wash., and the vets have documented the process online.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The world began following along with the cat’s nutrition and exercise plan on YouTube, Reddit and the vet’s Instagram page, before the fame became too real and Cinderblock received <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his own Instagram page</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It would appear that the workouts are going well for her. “Our chonkspirational Cinderella has really come a long way since day 1 in underwater treadmill therapy,” a recent caption from Cinderblock’s page reads. “Gaining more strength and endurance, she continues to increase her duration each time in addition to tolerating a higher level of water.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many people have fallen in love with Cinderblock’s reluctant dedication to her fitness regiment, commenting that they have felt similarly in their workouts before, and providing encouragement.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">1. Smudge the Cat</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The top cat on our list is best known for his part in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“woman yelling at a cat” meme</a>. Smudge’s owner first posted the now-famous image — of Smudge sitting at the dinner table with salad in front of him — on Tumblr in the summer of 2018, but it blew up in the summer of 2019 after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter user @MISSINGEGIRL</a> juxtaposed it with a screen grab from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. In the scene, which aired in 2011, Taylor Armstrong cries, shouts and points while co-star Kyle Richards tries to soothe her. The internet immediately fell in love with the two images used next to each other.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The meme needs little explanation: It looks like Armstrong is fighting with a cat, and people have shared it for all kinds of purposes, even taking inspiration from the construction to craft their own memes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Smudge is a rescue cat who lives in Ottawa, Ontario, and sitting at the table is really important to him. “He demands to have a chair at the table,” his owner, Miranda Stillabower, told TIME in an interview. “He hates to not sit with us at dinner.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Beyond the fact that “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">woman yelling at a cat</a>” has remained unavoidable months later, the data on Smudge’s fame speaks for itself: Smudge, who has also been dubbed the “table cat,” has 1.4 million followers on Instagram and multiple Facebook and Twitter groups dedicated to the fandom.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZub2dlgHV9jp%2BYpqelqHqqutOeqaedpGKztrrNsmScmaSofA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dans-quelles-conditions-un-syndicat-mixte-peut-il-recourir-aux-services-dun-agent-contractuel.html><span>←</span><span>Dans quelles conditions un syndicat mixte peut-il recourir aux services d'un agent contractuel, nota</span></a>
