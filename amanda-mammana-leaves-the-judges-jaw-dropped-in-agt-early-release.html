This 19 year old singer moves the judges with her powerful original song.</strong></p><p>Amanda Mammana takes the stage with her guitar in her early release audition. As soon as she’s on the stage, Amanda reveals her age and where she’s from. She then goes on to explain that she has a speech impediment that caused her to be shy, until she discovered that she doesn’t stutter while she sings. To show off her voice, she brought an original song about hard times to the stage.</p><p>Amanda’s song began lightly, but her talent clearly radiated through. Her vocals and original song had each of the judges jaw dropped throughout the entire performance. All four judges gave this singer a standing ovation. Once they sat down, Howie Mandel asked Amanda why she was emotional, in which she explained that she didn’t think she was good enough.</p><p>“Good enough doesn’t explain what we just heard, it’s not only good, it’s great,” Mandel said. “Look how you’re moving this audience. I believe you’re moving millions of people right now at home. I just want to say thank you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Each judge complimented her performance, explaining that she’s extremely authentic on stage. At the end of the early release audition, she earned four yeses. Amanda is moving on to the next round of America’s Got Talent. We can’t wait to see what else she brings to the stage this season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-amanda-mammana>Who is Amanda Mammana?</h2><p>Amanda considers herself to be a “multi-talented free spirit” within her website. On the about page, the singer explains that her speech impediment developed at the age of 10. Around that time, she became shy and insecure. She picked up the guitar as a way to escape, but it quickly became her safe place. She noted practicing a lot until she could play and sing at the same time. While she was in seventh grade, she joined her school’s worship band and later joined her church’s worship band.</p><p>She picked up songwriting later in life to once again battle her demons. While she enjoyed performing covers, the singer notes that she enjoys writing her personal experiences into songs. At this time, Amanda has three singles released to streaming. She currently has 20 monthly listeners on Spotify, 212 subscribers on YouTube, and 1,004 followers on Instagram. I think it’s only a matter of time until her social media accounts blow up. She was breathtaking on the America’s Got Talent stage, so I’m sure she will earn a loyal following very soon.</p><p>Tune into America’s Got Talent to see Amanda’s audition and <a href=#>more</a> this Tuesday.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Original_NickCannon_YouTube-1.png alt="Nick Cannon Releases Music Video for Song ‘Eyes Closed,’ Showing Fake Engagement" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKaYp5yRYrqiucyapZplnJqut7HSZquhnV2fwqWzxKxko5mnYrGzu8%2BpnJ1lmaN6orPTZpyaqpyuerOxy56YrJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-mixed-race-people-who-amazed-us-with-their-charm-and-beauty-809489.html><span>←</span><span>15+ Mixed-Race People Who Amazed Us With Their Charm and Beauty</span></a>
