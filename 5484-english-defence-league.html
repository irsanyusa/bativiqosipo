Contrary to widely held assumptions which trace support for counter-Jihad groups to the financial crisis, economic austerity and political isolation, our research for the report reveals that most respondents sympathetic of the EDL’s values are:</p><ul><li>Actively engaging in mainstream politics, and more likely than their fellow citizens to have voted at the last election</li><li>Not more likely to be unemployed, dependent on social housing or motivated simply by economic insecurity</li><li>Not necessarily young and uneducated. Less than a fifth (16%) of sympathisers in our sample are aged 18-29 years, and fewer than one in ten supporters has no qualifications whatsoever</li><li>Not simply anti-Muslim and overtly racist, but xenophobic and profoundly hostile towards immigration</li><li>More likely than the British public to expect inter-communal conflict and believe violence is justifiable and inevitable</li></ul><p>YouGov’s Political and Social Research Manager Laurence Janta-Lipinski comments “This new research helps to shed light on an under-researched and poorly-understood group in British society. The report helps to answer some of the fundamental questions surrounding these groups and challenges some of the widely-held views on their demographic make-up, core concerns and potential support.”</p><p><a href=#>See the results for EDL sympathisers</a></p><p><a href=#>See the British sample survey results</a></p><p><a href=#>Click here to read the full Chatham House report</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZWmFdXnEp56loaOdeqWxxZ6lnJ1dobKis9Se</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1233620-lucy-devito-bio-age-height-net-worth-family-html.html><span>←</span><span>Lucy DeVito bio: age, height, net worth, family</span></a>
