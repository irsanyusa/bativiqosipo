That year, she starred alongside Macaulay Culkin in&nbsp;the movie, <i>My&nbsp;Girl</i>, a&nbsp;film that predicted a&nbsp;promising future in&nbsp;the industry for both children.</p><p>The predictions did come true for Macaulay Culkin, who eventually played Kevin McCallister in&nbsp;<i>Home Alone</i>. But Anna Chlumsky didn’t manage to&nbsp;land such a&nbsp;big role, even though she was just as&nbsp;talented. Somehow, her job opportunities and her personal experience in&nbsp;the public eye were not as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;that of&nbsp;her fellow actor’s debut.</p><p><h2>How the industry turned its back on&nbsp;her</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/068/2c6/5c1c3659839c2bc9945ad0f6ce.jpg><p>Despite the success of&nbsp;the film that brought Chlumsky fame, big job offers were not forthcoming, as&nbsp;she only participated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few&nbsp;TV shows. “I&nbsp;was going through puberty and&nbsp;I didn’t look pretty on&nbsp;screen. I&nbsp;auditioned a&nbsp;lot during my&nbsp;adolescence and&nbsp;I just didn’t fit&nbsp;in, so&nbsp;that took its toll on&nbsp;me&nbsp;because, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, it’s not so&nbsp;much fun to&nbsp;be&nbsp;told that someone doesn’t like you anymore,” she said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><p>Now, as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reflects</a> on&nbsp;the effects that early fame had on&nbsp;her. “When you suddenly put professional, financial, adult and public pressures on&nbsp;children, you not only open them up&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;world that is&nbsp;commoditizing and objectifying them. You’re also setting them back from their ability to&nbsp;develop. So&nbsp;when they are faced with adult life, the tools aren’t there. [...] It&nbsp;was only as&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult that&nbsp;I discovered any sense of&nbsp;reliability or&nbsp;security. When I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;child those did not exist, because&nbsp;I was for sale,” Chlumsky confessed.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new beginning</h2></p><p>Her need to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;world that rejected her and didn’t allow her to&nbsp;have the life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;normal child and teenager was more than enough to&nbsp;have her leave everything behind and go&nbsp;in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;her destiny. She attended the University of&nbsp;Chicago and graduated with a&nbsp;degree in&nbsp;international studies in&nbsp;2002. There, she met her current husband, whom she married in&nbsp;2008, and they had 2&nbsp;daughters, Penelope and Clara.</p><p>Chlumsky moved to&nbsp;New York and worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fact-checker for a&nbsp;major restaurant review firm, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>as&nbsp;well</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;editorial assistant, but despite wanting to&nbsp;live quietly, away from cameras, the lights of&nbsp;Broadway reawakened her love for acting. “I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;I wasn’t going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress. I&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;New York right after college and seeing enough Broadway shows inspired me&nbsp;to&nbsp;try again,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>.</p><p><h2>Going back to&nbsp;her passion</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ee/0aa/0d089450bd8227b3cb3df44a49.jpg><p>Her return to&nbsp;the screen was slow but steady. She appeared in&nbsp;TV shows and was part of&nbsp;some episodes of&nbsp;<i>Law and Order</i> and <i>Hannibal</i>, but it&nbsp;was her role in&nbsp;the comedy series, <i>Veep</i>, that proved to&nbsp;everyone that Chlumsky was back. She was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominated</a> for 6&nbsp;Emmy Awards for that role throughout the 7&nbsp;years it&nbsp;was on&nbsp;air.</p><p>In&nbsp;2022, she jumped on&nbsp;board one of&nbsp;the most important streaming platforms in&nbsp;the world, co-starring in&nbsp;<i>Inventing Anna</i>, <a href=# title=Netflix data-link=tag>Netflix</a>’s hit series produced by&nbsp;Shondaland, the producer of&nbsp;big hits like <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> and <i>Bridgerton</i>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new beginning</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f91/e37/d79afc5e418a1f07f2861330a4.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;prepare myself and know that I’m strong enough to&nbsp;persevere through that (acting work) and rational enough to&nbsp;realize that a&nbsp;person can get any role, and that doesn’t mean it’s personal. It&nbsp;doesn’t mean you’re bad. I&nbsp;approached it&nbsp;from a&nbsp;much healthier point of&nbsp;view,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> of&nbsp;her new approach to&nbsp;the career she loves so&nbsp;much, and we’re glad she has chosen it&nbsp;again.</p><p>At&nbsp;what moment and in&nbsp;what area of&nbsp;your life did you feel the need to&nbsp;change your path and start from scratch?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6vusBmmqGkpaLArMXSZqqtp6KuerW0wK1kqaqfq7K0ediorGabkaN6rq3KnmSirF2pvG7Ax55kraegYrK3sc1moJ9lmKS5rcXWqKadZZSasq6%2FjLKmrqqVYruwwIypqZ6spK56prrOrp6hZWhlhHF9kWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alliance-villes-emploi-veut-peser-dans-le-debat-des-presidentielles.html><span>←</span><span>Alliance Villes Emploi veut peser dans le dbat des prsidentielles</span></a>
