<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>If Youve Never Seen Edge of Rain, Thats Why</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A&nbsp;giant, roiling mountain of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thundercloud is&nbsp;moving towards you. It’s completely black and goes in&nbsp;stark contrast with the bright blue sky right above and behind you. You see a&nbsp;blinding flash and, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few seconds, a&nbsp;deafening whip-like crack of&nbsp;thunder. And then, the rain starts gushing down from the heavens.</p><p>The wind rises, you see treetops bending low towards the ground some miles away and getting closer by&nbsp;the second. You freeze in&nbsp;place, realizing you can’t escape anyway. But when the rain almost reaches you, its movement suddenly stops. Just a&nbsp;few feet before you, there’s a&nbsp;veritable flood, but right where you stand, it’s dry and even sunny. And after a&nbsp;short while, the angry thundercloud spills its last drops and disperses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/043/a40/9377145545be5152353f795a87.png><p>Seeing the edge of&nbsp;rain is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare thing but not impossible. The rain has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;really powerful, so&nbsp;that the wind couldn’t diverge the drops from their vertical path. If&nbsp;the rain is&nbsp;light, you’ll only be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;see its edges from far away: it&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;shimmering gray haze going all the way from the sky to&nbsp;the ground.</p><p>Now the rain’s passed, but the wind is&nbsp;still blowing and rising ever stronger. You see leaves flying around in&nbsp;a&nbsp;circular pattern and realize a&nbsp;tornado is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;start. You run as&nbsp;fast and far away as&nbsp;you can, climb some hill, and only then stop and turn around. No&nbsp;tornado yet, but the cloud that’s hanging up&nbsp;there looks menacing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9f3/12d/ac00e05dd8ae76a3db11b7c34d.png><p>Another flash and a&nbsp;whip crack&nbsp;— the lightning has struck a&nbsp;lone tree near where you just stood! It’s caught on&nbsp;fire, and... there’s a&nbsp;column of&nbsp;flames rising to&nbsp;the sky. Still no&nbsp;rain, and the pillar becomes taller and taller. You’ve heard of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;thing but never seen&nbsp;it: a&nbsp;fire tornado.</p><p>These phenomena occur when the wind is&nbsp;caught in&nbsp;a&nbsp;circle close to&nbsp;the ground because of&nbsp;the difference in&nbsp;air pressure. Such mini-tornadoes are usually easy to&nbsp;notice&nbsp;— small rubble, dust, sand, and leaves rise into the air and start flying in&nbsp;rapid circles.</p><p>But then, if&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;fire nearby, the funnel can catch it&nbsp;and blow it&nbsp;stronger, like bellows. The flames go&nbsp;round and round, reaching ever higher and eventually creating a&nbsp;swirling, blazing tower. Luckily, fire tornadoes are short-lived and don’t normally cause much damage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/173/930/dfea065b9db5d5f35136f97893.png><p>If&nbsp;that wasn’t enough, you feel some rumbling from below. No, it’s not your tummy. It’s low and ominous. You look up&nbsp;and see strange lights hanging above the ground. They look like shimmering balls of&nbsp;light hovering high up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the sky. Your throat goes dry and you gulp. That’s what they call the “<a href=# title=earthquake data-link=tag>earthquake</a> lights.”</p><p>This phenomenon is&nbsp;poorly understood, but witnesses say they’ve seen it&nbsp;in&nbsp;different shapes and sizes. It&nbsp;could be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;light balls, sheet lightning, streamers, and steady glow in&nbsp;the sky. Soon after, a&nbsp;strong earthquake follows. Scientists can’t explain why those lights appear, and they don’t always do&nbsp;either. Some believe that’s a&nbsp;reaction of&nbsp;underground gases released into the atmosphere.</p><p>Sure enough, an&nbsp;earthquake begins, but lucky you&nbsp;— it’s not as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;you expected. The ground is&nbsp;shaking, but you even manage to&nbsp;keep your balance. It&nbsp;stops as&nbsp;abruptly as&nbsp;it&nbsp;began, and you walk home.</p><p>Later that night, you look out the window and see something incredible: a&nbsp;<a href=# title=rainbow data-link=tag>rainbow</a>! But it’s dark already, and the moon is&nbsp;shining in&nbsp;the clear night skies... Ah, wait, that’s exactly what it&nbsp;is&nbsp;— a&nbsp;moonbow! Also called a&nbsp;lunar rainbow, this event occurs extremely rarely. It’s similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular rainbow in&nbsp;everything except that it&nbsp;appears on&nbsp;a&nbsp;clear moony night after a&nbsp;rain shower. Thankful for such a&nbsp;spectacle, you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;sleep.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/73f/95f/d18391589198f409c09670af39.png><p>Next morning, you look out the window again, and suddenly, the sun is&nbsp;all but blocked, and it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;night again. You hear distant rustling and some kind of&nbsp;cawing. Puzzled, you look&nbsp;up, and you can’t believe your eyes: there are thousands upon thousands of&nbsp;birds in&nbsp;the sky&nbsp;— so&nbsp;many that they block all sunlight.</p><p>This is&nbsp;called Sort Sol, or&nbsp;“black sun” in&nbsp;Danish&nbsp;— very fitting. Normally, it&nbsp;only happens in&nbsp;Denmark (hence the name), where numerous migratory starlings take to&nbsp;the air at&nbsp;the same time to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;stay for the winter. There are so&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them that they literally make the sky go&nbsp;black for a&nbsp;few moments. So, what are they doing where you are&nbsp;— well, that’s a&nbsp;good question.</p><p>Okay, you’re now magically teleported to&nbsp;Antarctica. We’re in&nbsp;an&nbsp;imaginary universe, so&nbsp;anything can happen! Of&nbsp;course, you’re properly dressed in&nbsp;warm and cozy clothes. You look around in&nbsp;bewilderment and realize you’ve been transported to&nbsp;the slopes of&nbsp;Mount Erebus&nbsp;— one of&nbsp;many volcanoes of&nbsp;the icy continent. Right now, it’s slowly cooking, gas seeping out from its top and fissures on&nbsp;the sides.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/492/47f/0c832f5b1babcd6de319bfbe6b.png><p>What draws your attention, though, are snowy pillars all around you. These are known as&nbsp;snow chimneys. They form thanks to&nbsp;the boiling magma underneath. It&nbsp;occasionally spews up&nbsp;hot gas towards the surface, but the chill outside stops the hot stuff. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, [ice] fumaroles are formed: the hot gas freezes over as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;it&nbsp;hits the air, creating peculiar ice statues. They let out thin strands of&nbsp;smoke almost all the time and grow as&nbsp;the gas tries to&nbsp;escape from the nether.</p><p>Well, that’s enough of&nbsp;the freezing cold and volcanoes&nbsp;— time to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;milder climes. Whoosh&nbsp;— and you’re in&nbsp;Los Angeles. Look up! Almost right above you, there’s a&nbsp;beautiful rainbow cascade of&nbsp;clouds. These are called a&nbsp;fire rainbow, or&nbsp;circumhorizontal arc. Again, it’s a&nbsp;rare thing, but here in&nbsp;LA [Los Angeles], it’s much more likely to&nbsp;occur than, say, in&nbsp;London.</p><p>Fire rainbows only appear when the conditions are right: it’s close to&nbsp;the equator, the weather is&nbsp;clear, there are feather-like clouds in&nbsp;the sky, and the sun is&nbsp;higher than 58&nbsp;degrees above the horizon. Such clouds are made of&nbsp;ice crystals, and when the sun’s rays hit them, the particles refract the light and create a&nbsp;rainbow. Wow.</p><p>Oops, jumping to&nbsp;another place again. This time, you find yourself in&nbsp;Indonesia, overlooking another volcano. Its name is&nbsp;Kawah Ijen, and it’s the world’s most beautiful fire mountain. You see it&nbsp;slowly erupting, but the lava lazily flowing out of&nbsp;its maw isn’t red; it’s blue!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0c9/0a0/2875e657828b62d0506bf684e9.png><p>Inside the Kawah Ijen, there’s much more sulfuric gas than in&nbsp;any other volcano. When the mountain erupts, the gas goes out under extreme pressure. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;it&nbsp;hits the open air, it&nbsp;triggers a&nbsp;chemical reaction which turns the fire blue. Ever seen a&nbsp;gas stove burning? Here, the principle is&nbsp;basically the same.</p><p>Whoosh&nbsp;— and you’re in&nbsp;the bitter cold of&nbsp;the Arctic. Oh, come&nbsp;on! Still, as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you see the frozen ocean, you forget all about the cold: there are frost flowers blooming on&nbsp;the surface! Marvelous crystals of&nbsp;fragile ice seem to&nbsp;grow from the thin sheet of&nbsp;the frozen sea.</p><p>Such “flowers” only occur near the shore or&nbsp;on&nbsp;lakes when the difference in&nbsp;temperatures above and on&nbsp;the waterline is&nbsp;drastic: at&nbsp;least 27°F [15°C] is&nbsp;required. When the warmer ice on&nbsp;the surface meets the colder air above&nbsp;it, water vapor appears and freezes rapidly. This creates brittle but beautiful structures on&nbsp;the surface, which can even grow taller with time.</p><p>Your next destination is&nbsp;not much warmer&nbsp;— still the Arctic Circle, but Siberia now. Strangely, at&nbsp;first you see nothing around but the endless green valley and a&nbsp;low hill nearby. But then, you notice that the ground is&nbsp;trembling. An&nbsp;earthquake again?! No&nbsp;— you see the hill shaking as&nbsp;if&nbsp;about to&nbsp;burst, and then&nbsp;it... actually bursts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/646/fbd/b18ce05d539c4ebd7daa8abdc9.png><p>An&nbsp;ear-splitting BOOM takes your hearing away for a&nbsp;few seconds, and you see huge boulders flying in&nbsp;every direction like meteorites. When you return your gaze to&nbsp;the ground, there’s no&nbsp;hill before you. Instead, there’s a&nbsp;huge, wide, and deep crater. You’ve become witness to&nbsp;a&nbsp;permafrost explosion, a&nbsp;new and poorly explored phenomenon.</p><p>The main theory is&nbsp;that low mounds sometimes form in&nbsp;the frozen plains of&nbsp;Siberia, pushed upwards by&nbsp;expanding natural gas hidden underneath. At&nbsp;some point, this gas can explode, leading to&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful burst, and the mound pops like a&nbsp;water bubble&nbsp;— a&nbsp;massive, extremely dangerous pop.</p><p>Look out, there’s a&nbsp;stray boulder flying right at&nbsp;you!.. Oof, you’ve been transported right on&nbsp;time. And hey, you’re back home! The thunderstorm is&nbsp;over, and... Whoa, what are those clouds? They look extremely sinister!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/251/410/41f84153e6a05139a9d250ff77.png><p>Well, don’t worry, they’re called mammatus clouds, and they’re perfectly safe. They tend to&nbsp;appear before or&nbsp;after a&nbsp;severe storm or&nbsp;a&nbsp;hurricane.</p><p>Normally, clouds form thanks to&nbsp;warmer air going&nbsp;up, but these ones form because of&nbsp;cooler air sinking down. It&nbsp;creates pockets made of&nbsp;ice and water, which droop down in&nbsp;distinct lobes. They don’t hold on&nbsp;for too long, though&nbsp;— 15&nbsp;minutes at&nbsp;the most, and then they’re gone.</p><p>You look at&nbsp;the sight, shake your head, and go&nbsp;home. That’s a&nbsp;bit too much for one day.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorK%2BdXaOyt7HRZqqenZ5isqWzxGamn2WilravedOhmK2rXay1unmXampyaGBk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1539737-don-brymo-didnt-collapse-movie-set-agn-president-emeka-rollas-debunks-rumours.html><span>←</span><span>Don Brymo Didnt Collapse on Movie Set: AGN President Emeka Rollas Debunks Rumours</span></a>
