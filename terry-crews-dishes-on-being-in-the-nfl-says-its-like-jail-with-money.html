In 1991, he began his NFL career with the Los Angeles Rams, followed by stints with the Green Bay Packers, San Diego Chargers, Rhein Fire in Germany, Washington Redskins, and finally, the Philadelphia Eagles. For those who may not know, he concluded his NFL career in 1997.</p><p>He then went on to describe the culture, noting “intimidation,” “humiliation,” and “constant competition” within the league. To him, the atmosphere felt similar to how he thinks being in prison would be. He emphasized that NFL players often face instability, both mentally and emotionally.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>After parting ways with the NFL, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crews</a> ventured into Hollywood, where he achieved international fame and success. His diverse work portfolio includes roles in popular TV shows such as Everybody Hates Chris and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, as well as appearances in blockbuster movies like The Expendables series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">White Chicks</a>, and Idiocracy.</p><p>Additionally, he has hosted television game shows like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America’s Got Talent, including the spin-off series, AGT: The Champions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-terry-crews-revealed-he-only-earned-150-every-week-in-the-nfl>Terry Crews Revealed He Only Earned $150 Every Week in The NFL</h2><p>Crews’ experience in the NFL was not only demanding but financially challenging as well. Despite the fame and glamour often associated with professional football, Crews revealed that he earned a low income during his time in the league.</p><p>In fact, he mentioned that at one point, during his time on the Green Bay Packers practice squad in 1993, he was making just $150 per week. To put this into perspective, Crews humorously remarked that he could have earned more working at McDonald’s.</p><p>The financial struggles did not end with his NFL career. After retiring from football, Crews and his wife moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. During this period, they relied on loans from a former teammate to make ends meet. Crews even took up a job sweeping factory floors for $8 per hour at the time.</p><p>However, it was this determination that ultimately led to his success in Hollywood. Crews secured a job as a security guard for movie and television studios, which brought him closer to the entertainment industry. Over the years, he built a thriving acting career and became a household name.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_MariahCarey_Amy-SussmanFilmMagic.jpg alt="Mariah Carey Brings Home New Family Members — See Photos" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57056pq7FdmL%2Bmw9Jmm6KrmJrAbrvNZpmeoZ6ceqq6jK2fnmWem7luv8CyqmahpKh6rbXKnmSjmZmheri106FkpqeemsZw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peter-hitchens.html><span>←</span><span>Peter Hitchens popularity &amp;amp; fame</span></a>
