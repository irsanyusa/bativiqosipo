The musician talked about his experience in an interview after the reveal, sharing that former contestant Ne-Yo encouraged him to do the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shaggy-says-ne-yo-told-him-to-do-the-masked-singer>Shaggy Says Ne-Yo Told Him to Do ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>Shaggy said he did the show because he’s “allergic to boredom.” He shared that he’s good friends with Ne-Yo, who apparently told him, “Do it, man. It was great. You get to trick people, pick your own songs, and pay tribute to all your heroes.”</p><p>Ne-Yo was unmasked last year on Season 2 of The Masked Singer UK as Badger. He finished the competition in second place behind winner Joss Stone. Ne-Yo and Shaggy previously collaborated on the song “You Girl” in 2013.</p><p>Shaggy was surprised that judge Ken Jeong didn’t figure out he was under the mask, as he had recently appeared on Jeong’s show I Can See Your Voice. He added that he’s also collaborated with Nicole Scherzinger in the past.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>JEWEL SAYS PERFORMING ON ‘THE MASKED SINGER’ GAVE HER PANIC ATTACKS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-space-bunny-costume-was-hard-to-move-in>The Space Bunny Costume Was Hard to Move In</h3><p>Shaggy joked that when Ne-Yo encouraged him to appear on the show, he left out the part about “the 30-pound suit and how hot it would be.” He added that it was “hard to move around” in the costume.</p><p>The Grammy winner explained that his Space Bunny head was held up by a harness, which made it hard to move his hips. The eyes on his costume were moved remotely by someone else, so Shaggy didn’t have control over that aspect.</p><p>Shaggy thought some of the clues were “pretty obvious,” and was surprised that The Masked Singer judges took so long to figure them out. For example, the red hand print was a reference to his song “It Wasn’t Me,” where he says he was caught “red-handed.”</p><p>In the end, Scherzinger and fellow judge Robin Thicke correctly guessed it was him.</p>Something went wrong.
