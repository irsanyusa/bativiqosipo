Their age gap was one of&nbsp;the things people could not stop talking about. Priscilla <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was </a>only 14&nbsp;years old, while Elvis was 24. Even so, Priscilla stated that the King of&nbsp;Rock and Roll <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>’respected’ </a>that she was only a&nbsp;teenager when they were in&nbsp;love.</p><p><h2>The beginning</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/20d/787/01a69f568ba24e7d094160193e.jpg><p>Elvis and Priscilla <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>crossed paths</a> in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Germany data-link=tag>Germany</a> back in&nbsp;1959. At&nbsp;the time, Elvis was stationed there as&nbsp;a&nbsp;U.S. Army serviceman, while Priscilla’s family had relocated due to&nbsp;her father’s Air Force assignment. Someone invited Priscilla to&nbsp;visit Elvis at&nbsp;his residence one day, and she eagerly accepted. During their encounter, Priscilla caught the singer’s eye, prompting him to&nbsp;serenade her with a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;songs, even though she admitted she was just a&nbsp;9th grader.</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;that moment, Priscilla <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>, “I&nbsp;saw Elvis trying to&nbsp;get my&nbsp;attention. I&nbsp;noticed that the less response I&nbsp;showed, the more he&nbsp;began singing just for&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;couldn’t believe that Elvis Presley was trying to&nbsp;impress&nbsp;me.”</p><p>Initially, Priscilla <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>doubted </a>whether Elvis would ever call her again and believed their first date might also be&nbsp;their last. Yet, against her expectations, he&nbsp;did reach out. After a&nbsp;few days, Priscilla’s parents felt meeting their daughter’s crush in&nbsp;person was essential.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers </a>that Elvis arrived dressed impeccably in&nbsp;his uniform, a&nbsp;sight that greatly pleased her father. The two men engaged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lengthy conversation, and eventually, Priscilla’s parents were so&nbsp;charmed by&nbsp;Elvis that they allowed the young couple to&nbsp;continue seeing each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/229/e83/c8d031533eba6f6310964c96f0.jpg><p>Priscilla was a&nbsp;strikingly beautiful young girl who caught the attention of&nbsp;many boys at&nbsp;her school. She fondly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls </a>a&nbsp;particular incident when a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;her wearing a&nbsp;form-fitting sweater was mysteriously taken from the school bulletin board. Given Priscilla’s tender age, it&nbsp;wasn’t appropriate for her and Elvis to&nbsp;be&nbsp;seen together publicly, but they continued to&nbsp;secretly rendezvous.</p><p>Elvis appreciated Priscilla’s innocence and youth; their age difference posed no&nbsp;obstacle for him. He&nbsp;viewed it&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;shape the ideal partner for himself. He&nbsp;once confided in&nbsp;a&nbsp;friend, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “She’s young enough that&nbsp;I can train her any way I&nbsp;want.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17c/882/3de39e56e3a4d5c3fc1b460f1b.jpg><p>Priscilla vividly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembers </a>Elvis confiding in&nbsp;her about his vision of&nbsp;the perfect woman and his aspiration to&nbsp;shape her into that ideal. “On&nbsp;nights when his mood was calm and peaceful,” she recalls, “he&nbsp;would describe his ideal woman and tell me&nbsp;how perfectly&nbsp;I fit this image. He&nbsp;liked soft-spoken brunettes with blue eyes. He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;mold me&nbsp;into his opinions and preferences. Fidelity was very important to&nbsp;him, especially on&nbsp;the woman’s part.”</p><p><h2>Elvis ’Respected’ Their Age Gap</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9de/0ee/f7b1fa5132b269437ef44f8e95.jpg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;recent interview, Priscilla spoke candidly about the age gap between her and Elvis. She stated that he&nbsp;always ’respected’ her age.</p><p>“People often think, ’Oh, it&nbsp;was all about sex.’ But&nbsp;no, it&nbsp;wasn’t,” the pop culture icon said during a&nbsp;Venice Film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Festival </a>press conference for her upcoming movie, <i>Priscilla.</i></p><p>“I&nbsp;never had sex with him. He&nbsp;was very kind, very gentle, very loving, but he&nbsp;also respected the fact that&nbsp;I was only 14&nbsp;years old. Our connection was more about shared thoughts and understanding; that was the essence of&nbsp;our relationship,” she added."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b39/3c4/e3481e5226b614027927e18633.jpg><p>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p>Even though the couple didn’t mind the age gap, it&nbsp;wasn’t the case for Priscilla’s parents. However, she insisted that her soul was somewhat older despite being only 14&nbsp;years old.</p><p>“It&nbsp;was very difficult for my&nbsp;parents to&nbsp;understand why Elvis would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;interested in&nbsp;me&nbsp;and how. I&nbsp;truly believe it&nbsp;was because&nbsp;I was more of&nbsp;a&nbsp;listener. Elvis would pour his heart out to&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;every way while we&nbsp;were in&nbsp;Germany: his fears, his hopes, the loss of&nbsp;his mother&nbsp;— something he&nbsp;never, ever got over. I&nbsp;was the one who truly sat there, listened, and comforted him. That was the essence of&nbsp;our connection.”</p><p>“Even though&nbsp;I was 14, I&nbsp;felt a&nbsp;bit older in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;life experiences&nbsp;— not in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;age. That was the attraction,” she noted.</p><p><h2>Marriage and family life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f3b/000/80bdcb5caa8649877806684b8e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1960, Elvis departed Germany, while Priscilla and her family remained there. They would occasionally reunite when Elvis invited her to&nbsp;the United States. This pattern persisted for several years before they eventually tied the knot. Those years left <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Priscilla </a>feeling as&nbsp;if&nbsp;time stood still as&nbsp;she eagerly awaited Elvis’s sporadic calls and counted down the days until their next rendezvous. During this time, she couldn’t escape the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rumors </a>circulating about Elvis’s romantic involvements with other women, ranging from neighbors to&nbsp;celebrities.</p><p>Elvis proposed to&nbsp;Priscilla in&nbsp;1966, and they exchanged vows in&nbsp;Las Vegas on&nbsp;May&nbsp;1, 1967. Elvis, feeling the weight of&nbsp;potential scandal, chose to&nbsp;marry her. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued </a>his efforts to&nbsp;shape Priscilla into his ideal partner. Priscilla, who later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described </a>herself as&nbsp;“Elvis’s living doll,” underwent transformations like getting porcelain dental caps, refining her posture, dyeing her hair black, and styling it&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;updo to&nbsp;conform to&nbsp;the image of&nbsp;the King.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06a/4df/5a798e59eba2cd67ab73652a69.jpg><p>On&nbsp;February&nbsp;1, 1968, Priscilla welcomed their daughter, Lisa Marie. However, after becoming a&nbsp;mother, Priscilla sensed Elvis’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interest </a>in&nbsp;her waned. Much like before their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued </a>to&nbsp;engage in&nbsp;romantic entanglements with other women, and Priscilla frequently discovered love letters addressed to&nbsp;her husband. Over time, she realized she could no&nbsp;longer endure this and wait for him at&nbsp;home.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>, “My&nbsp;life was his life. He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy. My&nbsp;problems were secondary. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;grow. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things.” Priscilla grew weary of&nbsp;the pressure to&nbsp;conform to&nbsp;her husband’s expectations. She openly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted </a>that she never appeared in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;him without <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> and never dressed in&nbsp;his presence, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;preferred to&nbsp;witness the finished look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e8/8cd/b835f65918b615c4fc8b35f304.jpg><p><h2>Divorce and the King’s decline</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/874/aa0/7e0a13567a9274d49d84782358.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1972, Priscilla <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>informed </a>Elvis of&nbsp;her decision to&nbsp;leave him, leading to&nbsp;their subsequent divorce and a&nbsp;shared custody arrangement for their daughter. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;newly single woman, Priscilla flourished and worked towards taking control of&nbsp;her own life. Meanwhile, Elvis grappled with prescription drug <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>addiction</a> and financial troubles. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>engaged </a>in&nbsp;several romantic relationships following his divorce from Priscilla and even proposed to&nbsp;Ginger Alden.</p><p>However, their marriage plans never materialized. Tragically, on&nbsp;August&nbsp;16, 1977, Elvis was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found </a>dead at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;42. Priscilla was devastated by&nbsp;the news and found it&nbsp;nearly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>impossible </a>to&nbsp;accept. She had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hoped </a>that Elvis might have sought refuge in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hospital, hidden from the public eye for a&nbsp;while, and eventually returned. She later <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, “It&nbsp;was shocking. Like to&nbsp;the world, only a&nbsp;million times more.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34c/7a6/258bd95ce092b488171a339624.jpg><p>Despite their divorce and the strains in&nbsp;their marriage, Priscilla and Elvis maintained a&nbsp;close connection. She fondly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls </a>how he&nbsp;would reach out to&nbsp;share his worries; each call was a&nbsp;cherished moment for her. Following their divorce, Priscilla embarked on&nbsp;her career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and a&nbsp;successful businesswoman. While she never remarried, she did have a&nbsp;long-term relationship that resulted in&nbsp;the birth of&nbsp;her son, Navarone.</p><p>Priscilla opened Graceland to&nbsp;tourists to&nbsp;sustain the legacy of&nbsp;the home they once shared as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family. This allowed her to&nbsp;cover taxes and bills without selling the cherished property. Graceland has since <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>become </a>the second most visited residence in&nbsp;the USA, trailing only the White House in&nbsp;popularity. Priscilla remains dedicated to&nbsp;preserving the fond memories of&nbsp;her ex-husband, actively participating in&nbsp;events celebrating his music and still <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>referring </a>to&nbsp;him as&nbsp;“the love of&nbsp;her life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e7/0be/cb766551ac8643a563e01653f0.jpg><p>Despite an&nbsp;age gap, Elvis and <a href=#>Priscilla Presley</a>’s enduring love persisted beyond their divorce, demonstrating the enduring power of&nbsp;their bond. Their story serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;timeless reminder that true connections can withstand the test of&nbsp;time and circumstance, inspiring&nbsp;us all to&nbsp;cherish the love and friendship we&nbsp;hold dear.</p><p>Preview photo credit EAST NEWS<span>, </span>ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2ztdKcoKWkkWK9s7HSpZyyZaKaw6aty6xknqSmnsBuvsSsp56bpJqxbsDHmqtmq5iaerit0mamp6SpYn51edahnKdlpJ2yunnWnqmeZZmjeq271Z5kcWllZoN1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-jersey-mall-shooter-found-dead.html><span>←</span><span>New Jersey Mall Shooter Found Dead</span></a>
