<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>My Wife Opened My Eyes on How My Parents Have Always Mistreated Me, Now They Hate Us Both</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>A&nbsp;man, who’s 40&nbsp;years old, has written a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and told&nbsp;us about his family drama that developed after his wife told him the truth about his own parents. The man was suddenly seeing them under another angle, and so&nbsp;many things have become clear to&nbsp;him about his family. Now, his parents hate his whole family, because they weren’t able to&nbsp;accept the bitter truth and stood on&nbsp;their own position despite the man’s ruined life.</p><p><h2>The man is&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult, but he&nbsp;still feels the pressure from his parents.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fd/9fe/af1ecf570eaf934469b2c93116.jpg><p>indian heh</p><p>A&nbsp;man named Nick wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial, telling&nbsp;us about his very complicated family situation. He&nbsp;opened his letter, saying that he&nbsp;had somewhat of&nbsp;a&nbsp;revelation recently. Nick confessed that he’s still processing how he&nbsp;feels about it&nbsp;and considering if&nbsp;he&nbsp;should still talk to&nbsp;his parents once more or&nbsp;just let the situation remain as&nbsp;it&nbsp;is.</p><p>Nick wrote, «I’m 40&nbsp;years old, and my&nbsp;parents are 75&nbsp;and 78. At&nbsp;such an&nbsp;age as&nbsp;I&nbsp;am, the majority of&nbsp;people, I&nbsp;believe, are quite independent from all of&nbsp;their relatives, and they’re responsible for their own life choices. But it’s just not my&nbsp;case. My&nbsp;parents have always hated my&nbsp;wife, Ann, and even my&nbsp;<a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a>, and&nbsp;I had no&nbsp;explanation for&nbsp;it, up&nbsp;until recently.»</p><p>Nick explained more about his family background, saying, «I&nbsp;have 11&nbsp;siblings, and I&nbsp;am the oldest among them. All of&nbsp;them have their own families, and my&nbsp;parents have been just fine with&nbsp;it. But with my&nbsp;family, everything turned another way. Both my&nbsp;mom and dad have been very resentful about me&nbsp;starting my&nbsp;own family, and they always insisted that&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;remain single, that it’s good for&nbsp;me, and they know it&nbsp;for sure.»</p><p>The man added, «I&nbsp;moved out from my&nbsp;parents’ house when&nbsp;I was&nbsp;20, but&nbsp;I still came to&nbsp;visit them very often, and&nbsp;I spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time at&nbsp;their place. I&nbsp;had not dated much when&nbsp;I was younger. When I&nbsp;was 25&nbsp;I met Ann, and we&nbsp;started dating. We&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love very fast and got married a&nbsp;year later.<br>All of&nbsp;my&nbsp;siblings love Ann. She is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonderful cook and a&nbsp;perfect hostess. Our house has become a&nbsp;hangout spot. We&nbsp;have now been married for 15&nbsp;years and have 2&nbsp;kids.»</p><p><h2>Nick shared some of&nbsp;his family background, and his childhood was tough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fee/380/6a9d1a5d459658f5243e8d940b.jpg><p>The man wrote, «We&nbsp;have 12&nbsp;kids in&nbsp;the family and my&nbsp;younger sister, Jane, is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;year younger than&nbsp;me. So, since Jane and&nbsp;I were the oldest, we&nbsp;always helped with the smaller kids and the <a href=# title=chores data-link=tag>chores</a> around the house. In&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;was absolutely normal for my&nbsp;parents to&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;us as&nbsp;„Nick and Jane and the kids.“ It&nbsp;all was like Jane and&nbsp;I were not children at&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;was more like we&nbsp;were two other adults living in&nbsp;the house.»</p><p>Nick added, «We&nbsp;were homeschooled, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;were home all the time. I&nbsp;would wake up&nbsp;every day, make breakfast for all the kids, then help them get ready for their school or&nbsp;any other activities before&nbsp;I started my&nbsp;own schoolwork. Jane’s job was to&nbsp;help mom at&nbsp;night with the baby, and in&nbsp;our family there was always a&nbsp;baby.»</p><p>Jane and Nick did absolutely all chores around the house. Nick revealed that they took turns either cleaning the kitchen or&nbsp;doing the laundry, and there was always a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;laundry. Nick shared, «I&nbsp;did all the „man’s“ stuff, like mowing the yard and taking out the garbage. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;grew older, I&nbsp;would pass some of&nbsp;these chores to&nbsp;my&nbsp;younger brothers, but it&nbsp;was still my&nbsp;responsibility to&nbsp;control while it&nbsp;was getting done.»</p><p>The man added, «When I&nbsp;was old enough to&nbsp;drive, I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;run errands and take all my&nbsp;siblings everywhere. I&nbsp;can’t tell you how many times&nbsp;I took them to&nbsp;play dates or&nbsp;doctor’s appointments. I&nbsp;was also the person who would tuck the smaller kids in&nbsp;bed and tell them fairy tales. These things were all just normal to&nbsp;me, in&nbsp;our family&nbsp;I was more like a&nbsp;dad to&nbsp;the kids than a&nbsp;brother.»</p><p><h2>Nothing really changed as&nbsp;time went&nbsp;by.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/555/4ed/fc361f5458bcb4c40002d37ad7.jpg><p>Nick goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying, «My&nbsp;parents always said how important it&nbsp;was for Jane and&nbsp;I to&nbsp;help with the younger kids because mom and dad were so&nbsp;busy with their own stuff. Multiple times&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;drop what&nbsp;I was doing to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;something because mom or&nbsp;dad were „advising“ someone.»</p><p>Nick wrote, «When I&nbsp;got married, my&nbsp;parents and Jane did not like Ann. Now, Jane and Ann get along just fine, but Ann and my&nbsp;mom still have a&nbsp;very tense relationship. My&nbsp;dad liked my&nbsp;wife at&nbsp;first, but over the past few years, their relationship has also soured.»</p><p>Throughout the years, Nick’s situation with his family didn’t improve a&nbsp;lot. The man wrote, «My&nbsp;dad has made comments multiple times how&nbsp;I should keep up&nbsp;my&nbsp;responsibilities. Once, he&nbsp;even called me&nbsp;about one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;younger siblings, who had a&nbsp;fight with mom, and said „Speak to&nbsp;your brother and make him change his attitude! The way he&nbsp;treated your mom is&nbsp;very bad, and you need to&nbsp;make him apologize!“»</p><p>Nick said, «Our home is&nbsp;always open to&nbsp;my&nbsp;siblings, but at&nbsp;one point we&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;„discipline“ my&nbsp;younger siblings, and my&nbsp;parents didn’t take it&nbsp;well.»</p><p><h2>Nick had a&nbsp;talk with his wife and she told him about her point of&nbsp;view of&nbsp;their family situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/78d/d99/bee3ea5fb9bbc7203749f75b1d.jpg><p>Nick revealed, «Some time ago, Ann injured her feet and couldn’t walk for some time. When she was already getting better, I&nbsp;was diagnosed with a&nbsp;severe kidney disease. It&nbsp;then turned into a&nbsp;hard kidney failure. I&nbsp;underwent several surgeries and it’s been a&nbsp;rough year.<br>All this time, my&nbsp;parents completely refused to&nbsp;help, and they were actually trying to&nbsp;make things even harder for&nbsp;us. They promised to&nbsp;help with our kids, but then cancelled at&nbsp;the last minute.»</p><p>Nick and Ann had a&nbsp;serious talk about everything, and Ann told her husband what she actually saw in&nbsp;his family. Nick revealed, «My&nbsp;wife told me&nbsp;that she saw how my&nbsp;parents mistreated me&nbsp;all this time. In&nbsp;her opinion, it&nbsp;was because they „parentified“ me&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>, and now they hated both Ann and our kids, because they felt they were taking me&nbsp;away from them. When I&nbsp;became occupied with my&nbsp;own family, I&nbsp;helped them less and less, and&nbsp;I didn’t take their burdens and didn’t solve their problems as&nbsp;vigorously as&nbsp;I did it&nbsp;when&nbsp;I was single.»</p><p>Ann revealed one more thing to&nbsp;Nick, that made him totally petrified. She said that Nick’s mom once approached her and offered her a&nbsp;big sum of&nbsp;money, and Ann had to&nbsp;leave Nick and take the kids away from him, too. Of&nbsp;course, Ann declined this offer.</p><p>Now, Nick is&nbsp;fuming, and he&nbsp;doesn’t want to&nbsp;maintain any contacts with his parents. He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;them once about everything, but his mom had a&nbsp;meltdown and imitated a&nbsp;heart attack, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;was forced to&nbsp;end the uncomfortable conversation.</p><p>Nick closed his letter, saying, «I&nbsp;have never thought that what my&nbsp;parents actually did to&nbsp;me&nbsp;was destructive in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many ways. The things&nbsp;I considered normal were actually ruining me&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;personality and took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;my&nbsp;family life later.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story about a&nbsp;sudden and painful family decision. A&nbsp;woman had to&nbsp;kick her pregnant daughter together with her 6&nbsp;kids out of&nbsp;her house, because of&nbsp;the way her daughter’s family treated her. <a href=#>Find out more</a> about the woman’s dilemma and her tough relationship with her daughter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edainZ5ln6Wyr7HDZqSyZZWusrR5zqdkoaenYrq6ec%2BaqZ6mpKh6qa3VnmSapKeWxrR5zKKqraqVlsGmsIymnGamn6x6tbTEsmShmaSaera%2FjJumraBdbX55gJdtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-technologie-du-text-mining-le-service-de-pre-remplissage-automatique-de-vos-donnees.html><span>←</span><span>le service de pr-remplissage automatique de vos donnes</span></a>
