One possible result would for Chief Executive Travis Kalanick to take a leave of absence from the company he co-founded.</p><p>Chief business officer&nbsp;Emil Michael has left the company as part of Holder’s report on workplace culture, and Uber said it is naming&nbsp;Nestlé SA executive Wan Ling Martello to its board — its&nbsp;third prominent female hire in a week as the company looks to shake up its corporate leadership structure, <a href=#>The Wall Street Journal</a> reported.</p><p>Uber recently fired 20 employees following a parallel investigation into allegations of harassment, discrimination and unprofessional behavior, according to media outlets such as <a href=#>NPR News</a>.</p><p>Representatives from Uber did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>But the company’s drop in consumer favorability over the past week stands in stark contrast with the firm’s public perception earlier this year. Riders held relatively&nbsp;favorable&nbsp;views of Uber&nbsp;despite a string of scandals, including a video of Kalanick yelling at an Uber driver, and an ongoing criminal probe into the use of technology that was said to deceive regulators in certain cities.</p><p>Thirty-one percent of consumers on March 15 reported seeing negative news coverage of Uber, with 44 percent reporting a favorable opinion of the company. On April 1, the share of respondents who said they had a favorable opinion of Uber climbed to 48 percent, despite the fact that 30 percent reported seeing negative news coverage.</p><p>The decline in favorability over a short timeframe and during an especially tumultuous period could be an indication that riders are tiring of the constant scandals and crises roiling the company, according to some experts.</p><p>Benjamin Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, said the San Francisco ride-sharing pioneer has experienced “an amazing series of scandals” this year. The onslaught of negative coverage is finally beginning to take its toll on consumers, he said</p><p>“Users can accept and forgive certain transgressions, and Uber’s low prices and good product quality have made users more forgiving,” Edelman said.&nbsp;“But eventually it all adds up.&nbsp;As the outrages get both more severe and more frequent, users predictably run out of forgiveness.”</p><p>The ongoing legal issues and corporate scandals could portend a rough stretch for Uber’s perception among consumers.</p><p>“I’m reminded of road-runner cartoons where the coyote runs off the cliff, yet does OK for a while — yet eventually crashes to the bottom,” Edelman said.&nbsp;“My personal sense is that Uber has been off the cliff for years and is bound to eventually pay the price.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxgo5qaWiZnZ6xbq7AnWSprZKhtqS107JknKeipbyzrdOeZKKmpKe2qMHEZqybnaKoeq21ypqZoqSZqcZuvMuupKadpKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./95-des-chantiers-de-logement-ont-repris-en-ile-de-france.html><span>←</span><span>95% des chantiers de logement ont repris en Ile-de-France</span></a>
