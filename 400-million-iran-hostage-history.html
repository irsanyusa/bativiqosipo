Answer: The actual hostage deal that in fact accounts for the cash payment, which President Obama said on Thursday was not a ransom."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Hours later, five imprisoned Americans are released and board planes to freedom. If that situation—which took place in January—doesn’t look like a hostage deal, what does?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Answer: The <a href=# rel=noopener>actual hostage deal </a>that in fact accounts for the cash payment, which President Obama <a href=#>said</a> on Thursday was not a ransom.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The currency shipped to Iran in the dead of night drew attention from presidential candidate Donald Trump this week, who on Friday <a href=#>appeared</a> to walk back an earlier assertion that he had seen a payment being delivered. But that money was owed to the Islamic Republic since 1979, the year the U.S. froze all the Iranian funds in American banks as retribution for seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, as revolution swept that nation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What was universally known as the <a href=#>Iran hostage crisis</a> went on for <a href=#>more than a year,</a> and finally ended with a bargain: In exchange for the release of 52 American diplomats and citizens, both sides agreed to resolve the question of money through international arbitration. The <a href=# rel=noopener>Iran-United States Claims Tribunal</a> has trudged along for almost four decades now, and the money has flowed both ways. By 1983, Iran had returned $896 million to U.S. banks, which in turn had returned hundreds of millions in frozen funds to Iran. Today, private claims from the U.S. side <a href=# rel=noopener>have been resolved </a>to the tune of $2.1 billion.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But still at issue as Obama began his second term was $400 million that Iran in the late 1970s had paid for U.S. fighter jets, while Tehran was still a U.S. ally. After it turned into an enemy in 1979, Washington was not about to deliver the jets. But, all these years later, Iran wanted its money back—and with interest.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">All told, Tehran was asking The Hague arbitrators (comprising equal numbers of U.S., Iranian and neutral judges) for $10 billion. Fearing they might <a href=# rel=noopener>actually be awarded that much</a>, or something like it, the Obama administration negotiated privately with Tehran, which agreed to settle for $1.7 billion. The $400 million stacked on pallets was the first installment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The day it arrived, however, a great deal else was going on. January 17 was the day the international compact rolling back Iran’s nuclear program was set to take formal effect. It was also the day that Iran had, privately, agreed to release five Americans it had imprisoned on spurious charges. At the same time, the Obama administration <a href=# rel=noopener>would release seven Iranians</a> the U.S. had held for violating sanctions—the same sanctions that had brought Iran to the negotiating table, and indeed had necessitated doing business in cash, Iran’s banks having been cut off from the international banking system.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There were a lot of moving parts and fraying nerves at the time—and the whole teetering contraption nearly came crashing down when a couple of U.S. Navy river boats strayed into Iranian waters, and were taken by the Revolutionary Guards five days before the big day. To those who follow U.S.-Iranian relations, the <a href=#>swiftness of the sailors’ release</a>—the very next day—was the most impressive indication of how badly both sides wanted January 17 to come off as planned.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At least till now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The pallets of Euros and Swiss francs are even more vivid a symbol. To Iran-watchers, they show how badly Obama’s team wanted to bolster Iran’s moderate leaders, who had promised their public that the nuclear deal would produce immediate economic improvements. It also helps to bear in mind that Iran’s theocratic government works on a patronage system. When Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was president, it was <a href=# rel=noopener>his loyalists</a> who got the contracts to smuggle Iran’s oil past the sanctions; President Hassan Rouhani is now <a href=# rel=noopener>grappling with the fallout</a> from paying his own people tens of thousands a month. In short, cash and a show of good will were much in demand.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Were the prisoners a factor? <a href=# rel=noopener>Even on Jan. 17</a>, when the apparent quid pro quo was Obama’s grant of clemency to the seven Iranians, the concept of hostage-taking haunts every transaction with Iran.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The mullahs insisted that Jimmy Carter have left office before <a href=#>releasing</a> the 52 original hostages, minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in Jan. 21, 1981. The “<a href=#>arms for hostages</a>” scandal that marred Reagan’s second term brought together Iran, Central American insurgencies and U.S. prisoners held by Iranian surrogates.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nor was President Obama the first president to look for leverage in The Hague. A flurry of claims settlements in 1989 came as President George H.W. Bush attempted to persuade Tehran to help release more American hostages, a group that was being held in Lebanon. “I’d like to get this underbrush cleaned out now,” Bush said, after the U.S. announced it was releasing $567 million in frozen assets to Tehran. “I hope,” Bush added, “they will do what they can to influence those who hold these hostages.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the time, a State Department official<a href=#> quoted in TIME</a> acknowledged what amounted to a dance: “You want to do things that are justifiable on their own merits and defensible in terms of U.S. interests. And if Iran wants to take it as a signal, fine.” And, if not dandy, at least the way things seem to work with Iran.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGRmfXWCjm1naWWdnrmttc6nZKKqkaN6qbvSrZignV2dtrTAzquwaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-art-of-the-virtual.html><span>←</span><span>The Art of the Virtual</span></a>
