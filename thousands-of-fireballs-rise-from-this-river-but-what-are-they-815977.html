Nope, it’s not some spicy Thai dish. It’s actually a&nbsp;weird ball of&nbsp;fire that appears out of&nbsp;nowhere in&nbsp;the sky above the Mekong River in&nbsp;Thailand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/f2b/b0e/0a7e985b48b0c7787398d89b28.jpeg><p>Glowing balls are alleged to&nbsp;rise from the water to&nbsp;the air. The magnitudes of&nbsp;these balls range from a&nbsp;small sparkle to&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=basketball data-link=tag>basketball</a>. Locals reported having seen between tens and thousands of&nbsp;fireballs per night. This mysterious phenomenon has baffled and amazed people for centuries.<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> Legend</a> has it&nbsp;that the Naga Fireball is&nbsp;produced by&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant serpent-like creature called the Naga, who lives in&nbsp;the Mekong River and spits out balls of&nbsp;fire to&nbsp;ward off evil spirits. But science has another, “boring” explanation. The common belief among scientists is&nbsp;that these balls are related to&nbsp;methane gas igniting in&nbsp;the air. No&nbsp;matter what the reason&nbsp;is, thousands of&nbsp;people visit the banks of&nbsp;the Mekong River around<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> October</a> to&nbsp;witness this spectacle. So&nbsp;if&nbsp;you’re ever in&nbsp;Thailand in&nbsp;October and you see a&nbsp;glowing ball of&nbsp;fire in&nbsp;the sky, don’t panic. It’s just the Naga Fireball doing its thing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/af9/796/fff8665f2ea952dba4827e14ff.jpeg><p>Ah, the<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> fire rainbow</a>! Have you ever looked up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the sky and seen a&nbsp;rainbow on&nbsp;fire? Here I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;clear up&nbsp;a&nbsp;common misconception: the fire rainbow has nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with actual fire. It’s a&nbsp;type of&nbsp;cloud formation called a&nbsp;circumhorizontal arc. Try saying that 3&nbsp;times fast. It’s a&nbsp;rare and beautiful sight that happens only when the conditions are perfect. So&nbsp;how does a&nbsp;fire rainbow<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> form</a>? It&nbsp;all starts with some high-altitude cirrus clouds, which are made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;tiny ice crystals. When the sun shines through these clouds at&nbsp;the right angle, it&nbsp;refracts through the ice crystals and creates a&nbsp;stunning display of&nbsp;colors. The result is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rainbow-like arc that seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;fire. Now, you may be&nbsp;wondering why it’s called a&nbsp;fire rainbow if&nbsp;there’s no&nbsp;actual fire involved. It’s because of&nbsp;the colors. This phenomenon has vibrant hues that resemble flames, with shades of&nbsp;red, <a href=# title=orange data-link=tag>orange</a>, and yellow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/301/d4a/f997205f4d92857feb3b954d75.jpeg><p>Another rare display of&nbsp;nature’s awesomeness is&nbsp;the<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> Brocken specter</a>. Look at&nbsp;this giant ghostly figure looming over the ground. It’s actually a&nbsp;rare optical phenomenon. Instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular shadow, the person’s silhouette appears gigantic and distorted, surrounded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;halo of&nbsp;rainbow colors. It’s like your shadow gets super-sized and fancied&nbsp;up. The name of&nbsp;this trick of&nbsp;light comes from the Brocken mountain in&nbsp;Germany. This was the place where it&nbsp;was first observed. Imagine being the first person who experienced this. How cool it&nbsp;must’ve been!</p><p>Now, you may be&nbsp;wondering<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> how</a> this thing forms. It’s related to&nbsp;the way light behaves when it&nbsp;passes through droplets of&nbsp;water in&nbsp;the air. These droplets act like tiny prisms, bending and refracting light in&nbsp;various directions. When the sun shines from behind the person who stands there, their shadow is&nbsp;projected onto the mist or&nbsp;fog in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;them. The light gets refracted in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that their shadow appears much larger than in&nbsp;reality. Imagine seeing the shadow of&nbsp;Yeti! So, next time you hike in&nbsp;the mountains, keep your eyes open for this phenomenon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/2c1/b47/0142bd5590b5e665885d616503.jpeg><p>The next natural phenomenon is<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;St. Elmo’s Fire</a>. It&nbsp;forms when a&nbsp;strong electrical field is&nbsp;created in&nbsp;the atmosphere. Natural events such as&nbsp;thunderstorms and volcanic eruptions provide perfect<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> conditions</a> for St. Elmo’s Fire to&nbsp;occur. It&nbsp;can also be&nbsp;seen around airplanes when they are moving through <a href=# title=stormy data-link=tag>stormy</a> skies. On&nbsp;the one hand, I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;be&nbsp;on&nbsp;that flight and see this glowing thing firsthand. But on&nbsp;the other hand, I’d probably freak out being that close to&nbsp;it. The name Saint Elmo is&nbsp;a<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;reference</a> to&nbsp;Saint Erasmus of&nbsp;Formia. He&nbsp;was perceived as&nbsp;the patron saint of&nbsp;sailors. In&nbsp;medieval times, some sailors believed that this fire was a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;divine protection. Seeing this natural phenomenon during a&nbsp;storm meant that they would make it&nbsp;through safely. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>At&nbsp;the same time</a>, some other sailors perceived this event as&nbsp;an&nbsp;omen of&nbsp;<a href=# title="bad luck" data-link=tag>bad luck</a> and upcoming stormy weather. This blue or&nbsp;violet glow has captured the interest of&nbsp;not just sailors but also scientists. Apparently, the electrical field ionizes air molecules, causing them to&nbsp;emit a&nbsp;bright, glowing light.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/500/d1e/05c29a5ec7abf5ac972c00b8bc.jpeg><p>Next&nbsp;up, we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;special effect from a&nbsp;movie. Okay, maybe not, but the spirit is&nbsp;definitely the same. Let me&nbsp;introduce you to<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;blue jets and elves</a>. See, even the name of&nbsp;the phenomenon resembles a&nbsp;movie title. Anyway,<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> blue jets</a> are blue, cone-shaped bursts of&nbsp;lightning that shoot upward from the tops of&nbsp;thunderstorms. They can reach up&nbsp;to&nbsp;31&nbsp;miles into the atmosphere. Elves, on&nbsp;the other hand, are glowing light rings that appear above thunderstorms and can be&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;300 miles in&nbsp;diameter. While these phenomena are difficult to&nbsp;observe, scientists are working hard to&nbsp;figure them out. The way electrical charges build up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the atmosphere during thunderstorms is&nbsp;the key factor for these things to&nbsp;occur. When enough charge builds&nbsp;up, it&nbsp;can create an&nbsp;electrical breakdown that produces a&nbsp;blue jet or&nbsp;elf.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/758/651/537f9b518bb44b784a87fcfe5b.jpeg><p>I’ll continue with<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> striped icebergs</a>. Not the ones you put in&nbsp;your salad. These ones float in&nbsp;some parts of<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;Antarctica</a>. You see, when icebergs break off from glaciers, they can sometimes contain layers of&nbsp;ice with different densities and impurities. This ice mass floats in&nbsp;the ocean and gets gradually eroded by&nbsp;wind and water. The layers of&nbsp;ice become exposed. So, with time, different colors and patterns become visible. The stripes on&nbsp;these icebergs can come in&nbsp;different colors, like blue, green, and even black. The colors are caused by&nbsp;various types of&nbsp;sediment and organic matter that were trapped in&nbsp;the ice as&nbsp;it&nbsp;formed. Some icebergs can also have more intricate patterns, for example, swirls and spirals. They certainly look like art pieces.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/94a/fbe/d35ac6561a8b79aa74e984819b.jpeg><p>The next mesmerizing thing is&nbsp;again related to&nbsp;ice. Have you heard of<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>&nbsp;frost flowers</a>? It&nbsp;has<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> various names</a>, such as&nbsp;ice blossoms and crystallofolia. During fall or&nbsp;early winter, long-stemmed plants extrude thin layers of&nbsp;ice, which can take flower-like shapes. These ice formations have delicate, feathery tendrils. In&nbsp;2009, a&nbsp;biology team from the University of&nbsp;Washington discovered a&nbsp;field of&nbsp;frost flowers near the North Pole. The team melted a&nbsp;few flowers. They got shocking results. These ice blossoms held an&nbsp;unusually large amount of&nbsp;bacteria. It’s like the frost flowers are little gardens, but instead of&nbsp;leaves, they have bacteria. I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;they have a&nbsp;gardener, too. Okay, but how do&nbsp;these icy things form? Frost flowers are seen when the air is&nbsp;extremely cold and dry, and moisture is&nbsp;pulled out of&nbsp;little bumps in&nbsp;the ice. The air gets humid for a&nbsp;while, and then the cold makes the water vapor heavy. The air wants to&nbsp;release that excess weight, so, crystal by&nbsp;crystal, the air turns back into ice. There you&nbsp;go. This is&nbsp;how delicate, feathery ice tendrils are created. It’s like the ice is&nbsp;doing its own version of&nbsp;a&nbsp;magic trick!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a64/a5f/13b9fc5703b31c8b799a416789.jpeg><p>There are more ice formations than we&nbsp;could anticipate. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;mention another one because look at&nbsp;these colors! What you see on&nbsp;the screen is&nbsp;called<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> jewel ice,</a> and it&nbsp;can only be&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;Japan’s Tokachi River. The river is&nbsp;also known for its crystal-clear water. When the temperatures drop, and the river freezes, ice chunks move with the waves. These ice chunks look like giant diamonds! <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jewel ice</a> is&nbsp;transparent, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;reflects the light differently throughout the day. If&nbsp;you visit the lake at&nbsp;sunset, golden yellow ice stones will welcome you. But if&nbsp;you go&nbsp;there in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the day, they’ll appear blue. The color of&nbsp;the reflection is&nbsp;related to&nbsp;how light scatters in&nbsp;the sky. If&nbsp;you love the wonders of&nbsp;nature and taking pictures of&nbsp;these beauties, Tokachi River is&nbsp;probably a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;add to&nbsp;your “must-see” list. So, have you ever seen one of&nbsp;these phenomena firsthand?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpu9SsmKeco2K8p3nFoqmempGhubR50aKqnmWWp7yuedOhoKxlop7Dpr6Mm6ytZaedrrV5wKucZqyYmsZuhJBucHBvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./presumed-innocent-finale-explained.html><span>←</span><span>The 'Presumed Innocent' Finale Is Shocking But Silly</span></a>
