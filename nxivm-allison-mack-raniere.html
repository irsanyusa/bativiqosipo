He faces up to life in prison.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Raniere’s conviction is the likely the final blow to NXIVM, a self-described self-help community that attracted heiresses and famous actresses but was described by a former member as a “cult.” Over the past few months, several high-ranking members took plea deals in federal court after being arrested on charges that range from extortion to sex trafficking to possession of child pornography.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The downfall of NXIVM (pronounced Nex-ee-um) began in October 2017, when the Times <a href=# rel=noopener>published an exposé</a> in which former members claimed that they had been blackmailed, branded and nearly starved during their time inside the organization. (“There is no playbook for leaving a cult,” former member Sarah Edmondson said.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=# rel=noopener>FBI alleged</a> that Raniere started a secret subgroup of NXIVM called DOS (which stands for a phrase roughly translated from Latin as “lord over the obedient female companions”), in which women were kept as “sex slaves.” Raniere’s lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said on Wednesday that Raniere plans to appeal, and has maintained that all sexual encounters were consensual.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Keith maintains his innocence. It’s a very sad day for him,” he said, according to the Associated Press.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what we know about each of the members who has been charged.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Keith Raniere</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nxivm-sex-cult-01.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1998, Raniere co-founded NXIVM as a purported self-help group alongside Nancy Salzman. Raniere styled himself as a New Age philosopher heavily influenced by Ayn Rand; he was known as “Vanguard” within the group and began teaching classes promising personal and professional development by eliminating psychological and emotional barriers. An estimated 16,000 people enrolled in these courses.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the 2017 Times article, former members claimed that Raniere had manipulated them, branded them with his own initials, and formed a secret inner circle of women to have sex with. After the article’s publication, Raniere fled the country for Mexico, and in February of 2018, a complaint was issued in federal court requesting an arrest warrant. The complaint alleged that Raniere induced women to have sex with him by insinuating that he would leak damaging information and nude photos of them if they did not comply.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In March 2018, Raniere was captured by Mexican authorities, deported back to the United States and arrested. He was charged with sex trafficking and forced labor, and pleaded not guilty. In July 2018, he and several alleged co-conspirators (detailed below) were indicted on a slew of other charges that included racketeering, identity theft and extortion.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Keith never threatened anybody about anything,” Raniere’s lawyer <a href=# rel=noopener>Marc Agnifilo told Megyn Kelly</a> on Dateline NBC the following month.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Raniere was jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York. In January, the <a href=# rel=noopener>jail lost power</a>, leaving detainees stuck in freezing cells. Raniere’s <a href=# rel=noopener>request to be released</a> on bond following that incident was denied.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Raniere’s trial began in May, with a <a href=# rel=noopener>federal prosecutor alleging</a> that he used threats, “shame and humiliation” to coerce women into sex. During closing statements on Wednesday, prosecutors alleged that Raniere stole money through fraud and subjected his followers to sadistic punishments and starvation diets.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A jury took less than five hours to find Raniere guilty of all counts of sex trafficking and other charges accusing him of coercing women into sex. “Raniere was truly a modern-day Svengali,” Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue said outside court, according to the Associated Press. His sentencing is set for Sept. 25.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Allison Mack</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/gettyimages-954633222.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mack, an actress who played Chloe Sullivan, Clark Kent’s friend, on the WB/CW Superman series Smallville for ten seasons, said she joined NXIVM to “find purpose.” She soon joined its inner circle, and in a <a href=# rel=noopener>2018 New York Times interview</a>, said that she herself came up with the idea to brand women. “I was like: ‘Y’all, a tattoo? People get drunk and tattooed on their ankle ‘BFF,’ or a tramp stamp,'” she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Later that year, she was arrested and charged with counts that included sex trafficking and forced labor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prosecutors alleged that Mack played a key role in recruiting women into the organization. After she was charged, actresses and journalists like <a href=# rel=noopener>Samia Shoaib</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Noor Tagouri</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>said that Ms. Mack had tried to get them</a> to join her “women’s group.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On April 8, Mack pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of racketeering, and admitted to luring women into NXIVM. Her plea deal means that she will not be tried on some of the more lurid charges she faced.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was lost,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>said in court,</a> according to the Times. “I must take full responsibility for my conduct.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mack, 36, will be sentenced in September. She faces up to 20 years in prison on each count to which she pleaded guilty. A lawyer for Mack did not immediately respond to a request to comment.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Nancy Salzman</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nxivm-sex-cult-02.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Salzman is a former psychiatric nurse who co-founded NXIVM alongside Raniere and served as its president. Members of the group called her “Prefect,” according to court documents. After Raniere and Mack were arrested, Salzman’s home was raided by federal agents, who seized $523,000 in cash. Several months later, she was arrested and charged with racketeering conspiracy and identity theft.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In March, <a href=# rel=noopener>she pleaded guilty</a> and confessed to stealing email addresses and passwords of suspected moles in the group, and ordering video tapes to be doctored.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I accept that some of what I did was not just wrong, but criminal,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>said in court,</a> according to the Associated Press. “If I could go back and do it all over again, I would. But I can’t.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Salzman, 64, has her sentencing scheduled for July. A legal representative for Salzman did not immediately respond to a request to comment.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Lauren Salzman</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nxivm-sex-cult-05.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The daughter of Nancy Salzman, Lauren served on NXIVM’s executive board for many years. During that time, she oversaw branding ceremonies, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to the Times</a>. She <a href=# rel=noopener>pleaded guilty</a> to conspiracy charges in March. The <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Post reported</a> that she admitted she had “knowingly and intentionally harbored” an unnamed woman in a locked room for more than two years, threatening to deport her to Mexico.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Salzman, 42, testified against Mr. Raniere during his trial. She described the branding ceremony as “the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced,” and said the women in D.O.S. were subject to punishments like standing barefoot in the snow, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to the New York Times</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Salzman is scheduled to be sentenced in September.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A legal representative for Salzman did not immediately respond to a request to comment.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Clare Bronfman</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nxivm-sex-cult-03.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bronfman is an heiress to the Seagram liquor company. She also served on NXIVM’s executive board and allegedly created an access point for the company to dip into her family’s fortune. In 2010, <a href=# rel=noopener>a lawsuit claimed </a>that many millions of her family’s money had been spent in connection with NXIVM.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In recent years, Bronfman <a href=# rel=noopener>financed and pursued lawsuits</a> against NXIVM’s enemies. In 2018 she was arrested and charged with racketeering, identity theft in order to access other people’s computers, encouraging and inducing illegal entry, and money laundering. She was <a href=# rel=noopener>released on $100 million bond</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When asked in court in March about Michael Avenatti’s involvement on her legal team, she <a href=# rel=noopener>had a fainting spell</a> and had to be removed on a stretcher.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In April, Bronfman pleaded guilty to conspiring to conceal and harbor an undocumented immigrant for financial gain, and fraudulent use of identification. “I am truly remorseful,” <a href=# rel=noopener>she said in court</a>, according to the New York Times.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bronfman, 40, will be sentenced in July.

She was arrested and charged with racketeering conspiracy along with the rest of the inner circle in 2018. <a href=# rel=noopener>Prosecutors allege</a> Russell conspired with Raniere to smuggle a nonresident alien into the United States through Canada by giving the person an ID card with the information of a dead woman.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Russell, 61, pleaded guilty in April to one count of visa fraud.
