Shoot us an email if we missed any of your favorites.</p><p>Upstate Beer & Oyster Bar</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> Six oysters and a beer for $12<strong>Hours:</strong> 5-7 p.m. daily<strong>Address:</strong></p><p>Maison Premiere</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> Oysters starting at $1.25<strong>Hours:</strong> Monday to Friday 4-7 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday 11 a.m. – 1 p.m.<strong>Address:</strong></p><p>The Mermaid Inn</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 oysters, $5 beers<strong>Hours:</strong> All night Monday; Tues-Fri 5-7 p.m.; Sat-Sun 4-7 p.m. <strong>Address:</strong> 96 Second Ave. and 568 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The nautical theme can look really kitschy really fast, but Mermaid Inn manages to get the ambiance just right. Seafood-wise, Mermaid Inn's secret sauce is consistency: everything's always pretty good. The oysters were smaller relative to other happy hours, but, hey, they were clean.</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 oysters<strong>Hours:</strong> 5-6:30 p.m. daily<strong>Address:</strong> 688 Franklin Ave, Brooklyn, NY</p><p>This Crown Heights favorite serves dollar oysters every day, including the weekend. As a nice bonus, Mayfield doesn’t serve Blue Points, the most common dollar oyster in New York — instead, they usually have a selection of both east coast and west coast oysters available. The cosy restaurant has a warm interior featuring seating pews recovered from an old church in the south.</p><p>Cull & Pistol</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 oysters<strong>Hours:</strong> Mon-Fri, 4-6 p.m.<strong>Address:</strong> 75 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY (Inside Chelsea Market)</p><p>This hidden, tiny joint in Chelsea Market specializes in seafood, so everything it serves is fresh. You can pair delicious custom cocktails with a variety of raw oysters — they usually have a selection from Maine, Massachusetts, New York, and the west coast, and during happy hour, all of the selections are $1. If you’d like to try a different bivalve, Cull & Pistol also serves clams and scallops on the half-shell. Grab a seat by the bar.</p><p>The Ten Bells</p><p><strong>Deal: </strong>$1 oysters, $15 carafes of wine<strong>Hours:</strong> Opening to 7 p.m.<strong>Address:</strong></p><p>Desnuda Williamsburg</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 east coat oysters (and clams)<strong>Hours:</strong> Sunday and Monday all night, Tuesday-Saturday 6-8 p.m.<strong>Address:</strong> 221 South 1st Street, Brooklyn, NY</p><p>Come for the oyster happy hour. Stay for the ceviche.</p><p>The oysters come with an original trio of sauces — tosazu jelly, ginger shallot relish, and chipotle mignonette — which is a cool detour from the standard shallot-vinegar slash cocktail sauce combo. Desnuda also serves tea smoked oysters, which aren't part of the deal, but are worth a taste.</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1.50 oysters<strong>Hours:</strong> Monday-Friday 6-8 p.m.; weekends 5-7 p.m.<strong>Address:</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The oysters — and the food — are really sort of an afterthought. But when it comes to ambience, St. Mazie goes all in on the Hemingway novel thing. Sultry lighting; not-trying-too-hard speakeasy feel; simple but done-right cocktails.</p><p>Pro-Tip: Alright, this has nothing to do with oysters, but St. Mazie also has live music later in the evenings, which is worth sticking around for.</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 oysters and half-priced drinks<strong>Hours:</strong> Monday-Friday: 5-8 p.m.; Thursday: 5 p.m.-12 a.m.; Sunday: 6 p.m.-10 p.m.<strong>Address:</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 oysters<strong>Hours:</strong> 4-7 p.m., daily<strong>Address:</strong></p><p>At first glance this looks like yet another snooze dollar-oysters-and-cocktails spot, but don't judge too quickly. Unlike most of Manhattan's oyster happy hours, Sel Rrose doesn't do just Blue Points. There's a wide selection that all go for a buck, and they were fresh, meaty, and shucked well.</p><p>Pro-Tip: Shout out to the Lavender Piscine, which features lavender ice that melts into the champagne as you sip.</p><p>(And no, the double-R in the name is not a typo.)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 oysters<strong>Hours:</strong> 4 p.m.-12 a.m.<strong>Address:</strong> 28 Greenwich Ave, New York, NY</p><p>Virgola is a West Village wine bar that looks like a 19th century alleyway — more or less what you'd imagine as the setting of an English murder mystery. It seats just about 20 people max, but somehow doesn't feel claustrophobic.</p><p>The oysters were nicely shucked, although they were a bit small.</p><p>BONUS: The Wayland</p><p><strong>Deal:</strong> $1 oysters<strong>Hours:</strong> 4-7 p.m., Monday to Friday<strong>Address:</strong> 700 E 9th St.,</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Oh, what the heck. We'll throw in a bonus to round out the dozen. The Wayland makes for a good mid-week stopover, especially for a group of friends. The small-ish oysters were on the briny side, albeit nothing a pseudo-Bloody Mary couldn't neutralize.</p><p>Pro-Tip: While the bivalves were a fair choice, the real star of the show was the BLT, featuring double smoked pork belly.</p><p>And now for something a bit different...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmnyntc2apZydXaOyuHnYqKmkZZOewbq%2FjGpoZpqVqMFuu9isq56qXZ2usbzYZp%2BoraKofK2Fy3Gno58%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-73-year-old-model-colleen-heidemann-makes-a-splash-in-the-beauty-world-proving-fashion-and-fun-dont-end-with-age-810532.html><span>←</span><span>Model at 73, How Colleen Heidemann Shows Us Age Is Nothing but a Random Number</span></a>
