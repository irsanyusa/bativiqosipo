But that can often hold equally true within a single country, with different people understanding the same turn of phrase to mean different things.</p><p>For instance, <a href=#>a 2017 YouGov survey</a> showed that should a Southerner invite a Northerner over for ‘dinner’, a third would turn up expecting to be fed in the middle of the day rather than in the evening.</p><p>Now a new YouGov survey shows that Britons making weekend plans may find themselves missing each other by a week, but this time it is age rather than region that makes a difference.</p><p>On Monday and Tuesday 13-14 September, YouGov asked Britons whether a series of weekend dates represent ‘last weekend’, ‘this weekend’, ‘next weekend’, ‘the weekend after next’, or ‘the weekend after the weekend after next’.</p><p>The results show that Britons are heavily divided is on how they would describe the weekend coming up: 18-19 September. While 40% of Brits think that is ‘this weekend’, a majority (56%) think it is ‘next weekend’.</p><p>The generations are at odds on this matter. Both 18-29 year olds (by 59% to 30%) and 30-39 year olds (by 51% to 41%) tend to think that 18-19 September is ‘this weekend’, 40-49 year olds are evenly split between ‘this’ and ‘next’ (47% to 52%), but the vast majority of those aged 50+ call it ‘next weekend’ (71, 70%) rather than ‘this weekend’ (27%, 25%).</p><p>Similarly, while 18-29 year olds tend to think that 25-26 September is ‘next weekend’ (49%) rather than ‘the weekend after next’ (39%), a majority of everyone 30 and over think it is ‘the weekend after next’.</p><p>The older Britons are, the more sure they are of this point. In the 30-39 age category, a small majority (57%) would describe 25-26 September as ‘the weekend after next’, but this rises to fully 79% of those aged 50+.</p><p>In all, around a quarter of Britons (23%) think that 25-26 September is ‘next weekend’, while two-thirds (67%) think it is best described as ‘the weekend after next’.</p><p>One in five (18%) think that 2-3 October is ‘the weekend after next’, with no fewer than 80% believing it to be ‘the weekend after the weekend after next’.</p><p>Again, even at this far end of the scale we see age differences: a third of young people (36%) think 2-3 October is ‘the weekend after next’ vs just 10% of those aged 65 and over.</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhraGaDennDqGSyp6ViwKLFjLCcnqOVo7Fuu9FmpZ6wpGLEprHKnqWdZZmpeqWxz56lnatdrry2vg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1315325-christopher-comstock-marshmello-bio-age-height-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Christopher Comstock (Marshmello) bio: age, height, net worth</span></a>
