With dozens of high-profile credits spanning decades and a successful production company, Pitt is regarded as one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood. Born on Dec. 18, 1963 in Shawnee, Okla., Pitt later moved to Springfield, Miss.&nbsp;and enrolled at the University of Missouri. Pitt eventually dropped out and headed to L.A. in the late ’80s, gaining acting experience with small roles in films such as “man at beach with drink” and “preppy guy at fight.” His mainstream breakthrough wasn’t until 1991 with Ridley Scott’s “Thelma & Louise,” in which he played hitchhiker J.D. This led to other leading roles including “Interview With the Vampire” (1994), David Fincher’s “Seven” (1995) and “12 Monkeys” (1995), which earned Pitt his first Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe for best supporting actor. Pitt continued to achieve greater commercial and critical success in the late ’90s and 2000s by establishing himself as a leading man for well-respected directors like David Fincher (“Fight Club,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,“), Quentin Tarantino (“Inglourious Basterds,” “12 Years a Slave”) and Steven Soderbergh (“Ocean’s” franchise).</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In 2011, Pitt produced and starred in two films that were nominated for best picture: the coming-of-age drama “The Tree of Life” and sports biopic “Moneyball.” His biggest box-office success, however, came in 2013 with the apocalypse movie “World War Z,” which made over $500 million. More recently, Pitt collaborated with Tarantino once again for “Once Upon a TIme in Hollywood” in 2019, for which he won an Oscar; starred in the 2022 action-comedy “Bullet Train” and has been buffing up his producing slate with titles like “Father of the Bride,” “She Said,” “Women Talking” and “Blonde.” Next, Pitt is set to star alongside George Clooney in the Apple TV+ thriller “Wolves.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BpfKO%2BwJ1kqaGkqXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-voice-is-currently-holding-a-virtual-casting-call-open-for-all-singers.html><span>←</span><span>'The Voice' is Currently Holding a Virtual Casting Call Open for All Singers</span></a>
