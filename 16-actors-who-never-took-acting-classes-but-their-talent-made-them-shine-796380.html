Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c41/b36/c49b415ff6b57a91e8e38a45db.jpg><p>Tom loved movies and he&nbsp;once worked in&nbsp;a&nbsp;play that <a href=#>changed his life for good</a>. He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;New York to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor, and 6&nbsp;months later, he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;break in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie called Taps. In&nbsp;1990, he&nbsp;became one of&nbsp;the highest-paid actors in&nbsp;the world and has always been humble about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>2. Jim Carrey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e6/ea7/cf40b95a5ab950d52e567f82d7.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jim Carrey" data-link=tag>Jim Carrey</a> had quite a&nbsp;<a href=#>peculiar upbringing</a>. He&nbsp;lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;van with his family when he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;teenager and had dreamed of&nbsp;living a&nbsp;successful life since then. He&nbsp;dropped out of&nbsp;school when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;16, to&nbsp;support his family, and later auditioned for many small roles. He, eventually, landed a&nbsp;role on&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV show called In&nbsp;Living Color, where he&nbsp;flourished in&nbsp;his <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. He&nbsp;has had much bigger roles since then and he&nbsp;never spent a&nbsp;penny on&nbsp;acting classes.</p><p><h2>3. Meg Ryan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5cf/2f2/50918e5fd094c65ab638b4d0ca.jpg><p>While she was <a href=#>pursuing journalism</a> in&nbsp;New York, she started auditioning for commercials and&nbsp;TV series. She ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;commercials for Burger King and AIM&nbsp;Toothpaste. And as&nbsp;her acting career flourished, she left her college a&nbsp;semester earlier to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;a&nbsp;feature film. She never received any kind of&nbsp;formal training in&nbsp;acting.</p><p><h2>4. Cameron Diaz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27e/a63/b1863b51c49a08adc65e755729.jpg><p>Once a&nbsp;famous photographer named Jeff Dunas approached Diaz to&nbsp;ask her who her agent was. When she said she didn’t have one, Dunas handed her his business card and told her to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;touch, once she has an&nbsp;agent. She became a&nbsp;model with Elite modeling agency, and then she also worked playing small roles. 4&nbsp;years later, she got her big break in&nbsp;<a href=#><i>The Mask.</i></a></p><p><h2>5. Johnny Depp</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99f/0d8/abea37529f96bcd065c410985c.jpg><p>Depp moved to&nbsp;California to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;musician. He&nbsp;first landed a&nbsp;job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;telemarketer selling ink pens over the phone. While working at&nbsp;this job, his friend <a href=#>Nicholas Cage</a> introduced him to&nbsp;his agent. Later, Depp ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;A&nbsp;Nightmare on&nbsp;Elm Street. He&nbsp;never pursued any formal training in&nbsp;acting school.</p><p><h2>6. Joaquin Phoenix</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2bd/32b/834b4e572ab795f80357128ea5.jpg><p>Phoenix has been an&nbsp;actor, producer, musician, you name&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;and his siblings used to&nbsp;perform on&nbsp;the streets to&nbsp;support their family. Back then, they were all <a href=#>noticed by&nbsp;an&nbsp;agent </a>named Iris Burton, who got them to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;commercials and&nbsp;TV shows. Joaquin took a&nbsp;break after his brother, River Phoenix, passed away.</p><p>His comeback bestowed him with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;blockbuster movies, where he&nbsp;himself won an&nbsp;Oscar and many other prestigious awards, like best actor in&nbsp;Joker.</p><p><h2>7.

He&nbsp;is&nbsp;famous for his legendary performance as&nbsp;Batman in&nbsp;the Dark Knight movies, but he&nbsp;is&nbsp;also famous for his <a href=#>method acting</a> in&nbsp;any movie he’s laid his hands&nbsp;on. He&nbsp;can make drastic changes in&nbsp;himself to&nbsp;deliver his performance in&nbsp;the best way.</p><p><h2>8. Russell Crowe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c0/d40/76748c5875a5c36d312c4271ba.jpg><p>Crowe became famous by&nbsp;playing Maximus in&nbsp;the movie Gladiator, which won him an&nbsp;<a href=#>Oscar</a>. He&nbsp;landed his first break because of&nbsp;his family connections. He&nbsp;also dropped out of&nbsp;school when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;16, to&nbsp;become an&nbsp;actor. His dedication has put him in&nbsp;some really good movies like Gladiator, A&nbsp;Beautiful Mind, and a&nbsp;lot more.</p><p><h2>9. Jennifer Lawrence</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae9/901/963faa5bc085bf1bc188f9c246.jpg><p>Jennifer convinced her parents to&nbsp;find her an&nbsp;agent in&nbsp;NYC to&nbsp;kickstart her acting career. Her first break was on&nbsp;a&nbsp;TBS comedy series called <a href=#>The Bill Engvall Show</a>. Gradually, she made her way to&nbsp;roles in&nbsp;movies like The Hunger Games, X-Men, and a&nbsp;lot more.</p><p><h2>10. Ben Kingsley</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ba/da6/3e9d775045933943ed0c32d503.jpg><p>Kingsley made his acting debut when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;23, from then on&nbsp;he&nbsp;continued doing stage work for the next 15&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;even turned down many big opportunities. His first movie, Fear Is&nbsp;The Key, was released in&nbsp;1972, then he&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;<a href=#>Gandhi </a>in&nbsp;1982, which won him an&nbsp;Academy Award. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;purely a&nbsp;self-taught actor.</p><p><h2>11. Channing Tatum</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/284/fae/c104cb5f2c8a4075c7ca0e3ce0.jpg><p>When Tatum left college, he&nbsp;worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;construction worker, a&nbsp;dancer, a&nbsp;salesman, and a&nbsp;mortgage broker. He&nbsp;was discovered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;modeling agency on&nbsp;the streets of&nbsp;Miami and he&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;print ads for many bigshot brands. Then, he&nbsp;gradually worked his way through many commercials and movies, which <a href=#>made him the star he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today.</a></p><p><h2>12. Charlize Theron</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e99/6a8/e7c2e259849ff612855731d1c1.jpg><p>Theron began her modeling career when she was&nbsp;16, then she pursued ballet dancing as&nbsp;well. After a&nbsp;few knee injuries, she quit everything and moved to&nbsp;LA to&nbsp;pursue her acting career. Trying to&nbsp;make ends meet, she started <a href=#>arguing with a&nbsp;bank teller</a> who refused to&nbsp;cash her out of&nbsp;state check. It&nbsp;was then that she was discovered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hollywood manager, who got her into movies.</p><p><h2>13. Henry Cavill</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b37/62a/88afee5b249a084b2b6f7ed1c7.jpg><p>Cavill was very fond of&nbsp;working in&nbsp;the theater when he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;school. He&nbsp;worked as&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra for a&nbsp;play at&nbsp;his boarding school. He&nbsp;landed one of&nbsp;his first roles in&nbsp;a&nbsp;film when a&nbsp;casting group for the movie The Count of&nbsp;Monte Cristo <a href=#>showed up&nbsp;at&nbsp;his school</a>. Cavill impressed the group and got&nbsp;in.</p><p><h2>14. Matthew McConaughey</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a8/2b9/f5755a53e9bf83e506182d877c.jpg><p>McConaughey was studying law at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Texas when he&nbsp;came across a&nbsp;book called The Greatest Salesman in&nbsp;the World by&nbsp;Og&nbsp;Mandino. This book changed his life and became the reason for why he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;pursue acting. He&nbsp;began his acting career by&nbsp;working in&nbsp;many commercials and student films. One day, he&nbsp;<a href=#>ended up&nbsp;meeting Richard Linklater</a> who later chose him for the part he&nbsp;played in&nbsp;Dazed and Confused. It’s no&nbsp;wonder he&nbsp;chose McConaughey for this role.</p><p><h2>15. Natalie Portman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/67f/485/33986852728ff28a64762f1783.jpg><p>When Portman was&nbsp;11, she worked at&nbsp;a&nbsp;local pizza parlor, where a&nbsp;<a href=#>Revlon representative convinced her</a> to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;career in&nbsp;modeling. But she found modeling boring and decided to&nbsp;pursue acting instead. Then, she signed up&nbsp;to&nbsp;attend the Usdan Theatre Arts Camp, where she was featured in&nbsp;many productions. Portman needed no&nbsp;formal training to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the terrific actress that she&nbsp;is.</p><p><h2>16. Heath Ledger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36f/faf/d6ec09553682915f30d938f5be.jpg><p>Ledger skipped school when he&nbsp;was 17&nbsp;to&nbsp;pursue his career in&nbsp;acting. He&nbsp;drove to&nbsp;Sydney along with his best friend, Trever DiCarlo, to&nbsp;seek acting work. His first break was a&nbsp;small role on&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV series called Clowning Around. Gradually, he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;well-known face after 10&nbsp;Things I&nbsp;Hate About You, and then he&nbsp;gave his <a href=#>best performance as&nbsp;The Joker</a> in&nbsp;The Dark Knight. Ledger is&nbsp;the ultimate proof that you need no&nbsp;training to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;the characters played by&nbsp;the actors listed above are your favorites?
