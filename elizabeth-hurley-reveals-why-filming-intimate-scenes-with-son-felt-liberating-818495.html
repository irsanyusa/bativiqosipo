The mother-son duo collaborated on&nbsp;a&nbsp;film that blurred the lines between <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and filmmaking. In&nbsp;the movie, Damian filmed some scenes of&nbsp;his mom, that raised a&nbsp;few eyebrows. Elizabeth, however, is&nbsp;defending herself and her son against the criticism.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;family affair</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc8/455/79a3af51f88169c98ce0992978.jpg><p>Elizabeth Hurley, at&nbsp;58, embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cinematic journey with her 22-year-old son, Damian. He&nbsp;not only captured her best angles but also provided a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;security and comfort. Damian stepped into the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;director for the first time. Elizabeth adds that Damian always wanted to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;film. And, he&nbsp;wanted her to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;it. Elizabeth agreed to&nbsp;join her son for his first movie.</p><p>He&nbsp;led his mother through unfamiliar territory with a&nbsp;nurturing presence. The film, an&nbsp;explicit thriller, revolves around mature themes. Reflecting on&nbsp;the experience, the young director shared that the swift 18-day Caribbean shoot <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> «terrifying».</p><p><h2>Their collaboration caused a&nbsp;stir.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e4a/7b3/788df3519186acedd7cc2e1e35.jpg><p>The film’s trailer, released in&nbsp;February, showcased a&nbsp;bold scene. It&nbsp;features Hurley in&nbsp;an&nbsp;intimate moment with her co-star. This wasn’t new for Damian, who had experience capturing his mother’s bikini images for social media. He&nbsp;expressed that their show business background desensitized them to&nbsp;the controversy surrounding such scenes.</p><p>Elizabeth <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>echoed</a> this sentiment, finding solace in&nbsp;being photographed by&nbsp;someone who genuinely cares for her well-being. Especially when the script called for actions she hadn’t frequently portrayed on&nbsp;screen. «I&nbsp;knew he&nbsp;would look after&nbsp;me. So&nbsp;actually, it’s kind of&nbsp;liberating to&nbsp;work with your family. I&nbsp;may do&nbsp;it&nbsp;again,» the actress revealed.</p><p><h2>Damian wrote the movie when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;20.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/254/73d/4c22c4564d8c2e90598d33a639.jpg><p>Liz emphasized the importance of&nbsp;feeling protected during production, a&nbsp;sentiment that extended to&nbsp;the post-production phase. Damian, too, recognized the comfort they found in&nbsp;working together. He&nbsp;further suggested that this film was just the beginning of&nbsp;their joint ventures in&nbsp;the industry. The mother-son duo are open to&nbsp;working together again in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><h2>Elizabeth stands by&nbsp;her decision to&nbsp;work with her son.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/559/dd1/fcc8ab56b68817e8aa77da71ed.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<i>Strictly Confidential</i>, Hurley portrays Lily, a&nbsp;widow who confronts the mysterious death of&nbsp;her daughter and husband. The plot thickens as&nbsp;Lily’s affair with her daughter’s friend becomes a&nbsp;pivotal element of&nbsp;the story. The fact that Elizabeth filmed intimate scenes for her son’s movie wasn’t received super well by&nbsp;the public.</p><p>But, Hurley quickly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>defended</a> the scene’s necessity. She stated it&nbsp;was crucial for the narrative and not merely for shock value. Despite criticism from some who questioned the appropriateness of&nbsp;the mother-son dynamic in&nbsp;this context, Hurley maintained that the experience was empowering and professionally fulfilling.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;famous psychotherapist says it&nbsp;might not have been the best parenting move.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9cf/dae/c04ea75e499cb92b626debf5e5.jpg><p>Dr. Jenn Mann, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>therapist</a> known for her work on&nbsp;<i>Couples Therapy</i>, has offered some guidance to&nbsp;Elizabeth Hurley regarding her recent film project. Mann suggests that Hurley should maintain a&nbsp;certain level of&nbsp;modesty around her adult son, Damian. The therapist believes that the nature of&nbsp;their professional interaction crosses the boundaries of&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical parent-child relationship.</p><p>Mann, who has authored two popular parenting books, speaks from a&nbsp;place of&nbsp;expertise. She cautions against parents engaging in&nbsp;such acts in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;their children, regardless of&nbsp;their age.</p><p>Another famous Hollywood mom who raised eyebrows for her unique parenting approach is&nbsp;<a href=# title="Alicia Silverstone" data-link=tag>Alicia Silverstone</a>.
