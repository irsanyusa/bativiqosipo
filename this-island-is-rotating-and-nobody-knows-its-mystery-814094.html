You walk along the picturesque Paraná River and find a&nbsp;perfectly round island in&nbsp;its delta. It’s slightly larger than a&nbsp;soccer field.</p><p>You come back a&nbsp;few days later and see that the island has changed its position! It’s moved a&nbsp;little to&nbsp;the side and spun around its axis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9ea/5bb/1b87d85110befc8bcfaa5cb95b.png><p>This is&nbsp;what happened to&nbsp;Argentinian director Sergio Neuspiller in&nbsp;2016. He&nbsp;discovered an&nbsp;island that constantly moves around its axis. He&nbsp;called it&nbsp;“The Eye.” If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;from a&nbsp;bird’s-eye view, you’ll see that it’s similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;slowly moving eye. It’s like nature itself is&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;you.</p><p>The director forgot about his initial movie idea and decided to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;documentary about this island. You can find the Eye in&nbsp;the northeastern part of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Argentina data-link=tag>Argentina</a>. Or&nbsp;you can open Google Maps and type “El&nbsp;Ojo” to&nbsp;see&nbsp;it.</p><p>No&nbsp;one had known about this place before the director found&nbsp;it. Perhaps, there are many such moving islands on&nbsp;the planet. If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;satellite images of&nbsp;this area, you can see other similar pieces of&nbsp;land inside lakes. But they’re not so&nbsp;round and don’t rotate. Surprisingly, scientists haven’t yet solved the secret of&nbsp;the bizarre island.</p><p>The most popular theory says that underwater wells create strong water flows and change the current that pushes the island from side to&nbsp;side. When the Eye collides with the ground, it&nbsp;bounces off like a&nbsp;ball, causing parts of&nbsp;its muddy shores to&nbsp;break off. But not everyone looks for a&nbsp;scientific explanation for this natural phenomenon. Some locals believe that the island is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;some kind of&nbsp;technology created by&nbsp;space civilizations. Oooh!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/26d/7c6/b742e95671a28fd00043f903bd.png><p>Our next stop is&nbsp;the smallest island in&nbsp;the world. No&nbsp;one can even step on&nbsp;it&nbsp;because of&nbsp;its size. So, here’s Vancouver Island in&nbsp;the Canadian province of&nbsp;British Columbia. Fairy Lake is&nbsp;located here.</p><p>Look at&nbsp;the water! You may not notice the island at&nbsp;first. Technically, it’s not even an&nbsp;island. It’s just a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;a&nbsp;log sticking out of&nbsp;the water. This log is&nbsp;covered with moss and <a href=# title=grass data-link=tag>grass</a>. But the most incredible thing is&nbsp;that a&nbsp;tiny Douglas fir grows on&nbsp;this piece of&nbsp;wood.</p><p>The photo of&nbsp;this tree has won many awards and become famous worldwide. It&nbsp;shows how desperately nature can strive for survival. Every day, many tourists sail around this island and get inspiration from&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c0b/cbb/6dc4b25d20a428822609e5fe89.png><p>The next island looks ominous and lifeless. It’s the perfect place to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;hut and write horror novels using an&nbsp;old typewriter. The place is&nbsp;called Ball’s Pyramid. It’s located in&nbsp;the waters of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>, in&nbsp;the Tasman Sea. You can see this colossal fin sticking out of&nbsp;the water from afar. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sharp stone ridge with a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;1,800&nbsp;feet, almost twice the size of&nbsp;the <a href=# title="Eiffel Tower" data-link=tag>Eiffel Tower</a>, in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;an&nbsp;uninhabited volcanic island.</p><p>It’s dangerous to&nbsp;approach the place and step ashore because of&nbsp;its slippery stone surface. Scientists come here with special equipment and probably some good boots with traction. The purpose of&nbsp;their visits is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mystery that lies in&nbsp;the heart of&nbsp;the ridge. It&nbsp;was first discovered in&nbsp;1788. The navigators who found it&nbsp;considered the island lifeless. And&nbsp;so, it&nbsp;was believed for more than 200&nbsp;years.</p><p>But then, in&nbsp;2001, people decided to&nbsp;examine the place again. A&nbsp;group of&nbsp;scientists arrived there and found one of&nbsp;the rarest <a href=# title=insects data-link=tag>insects</a> in&nbsp;the world. At&nbsp;a&nbsp;height of&nbsp;more than 100&nbsp;feet, a&nbsp;small bush grew. A&nbsp;colony of&nbsp;land lobsters&nbsp;— also called “walking sausages”&nbsp;— was hiding there. These are critters from the family of&nbsp;stick insects. They look pretty creepy since each of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;about 6&nbsp;inches in&nbsp;size, which is&nbsp;the average size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sausage.</p><p>Isn’t he&nbsp;the “wurst”? Get it? Wurst&nbsp;— sausage. Never mind. The bodies of&nbsp;these 6-paw beetles are covered with a&nbsp;hard brown shell. Scientists found 27&nbsp;insects, and their population keeps growing. These creatures were considered extinct at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century. Scientists still don’t know how these beetles got to&nbsp;this remote, harsh place and how they managed to&nbsp;survive there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3d7/459/9314f65f4fb45344de0d7eaa58.png><p>The next unusual place is&nbsp;probably the most isolated and one of&nbsp;the most mysterious in&nbsp;the world. Welcome to&nbsp;Bouvet Island, located in&nbsp;the southern Atlantic Ocean, 1,600 miles from the coast of&nbsp;South Africa and 1,100 miles from Antarctica. It’s possible to&nbsp;get there only if&nbsp;some big ship is&nbsp;passing&nbsp;by. An&nbsp;ordinary motorboat won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;reach this place because of&nbsp;the cold temperature and icebergs.</p><p>The island is&nbsp;completely covered with ice and has a&nbsp;volcano crater in&nbsp;its center. You won’t find anyone living there except penguins and seals. One French explorer discovered the island in&nbsp;1739. But then its coordinates were lost. People found this place again only at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 19th century.</p><p>But people set foot on&nbsp;the shore of&nbsp;this island for the first time only in&nbsp;1927. Then, closer to&nbsp;the 50s, they decided to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;weather station on&nbsp;it. Researchers came there and found something strange on&nbsp;the icy surface of&nbsp;the island. And it&nbsp;wasn’t due to&nbsp;the penguins and seals.</p><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;lifeboat lying in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small lagoon among the seals. It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;good condition. Not far from the boat, they found oars and an&nbsp;empty copper container. Perhaps some ship went down nearby, and the survivors reached the island in&nbsp;this boat. But the researchers found no&nbsp;traces of&nbsp;people. Until now, this boat remains a&nbsp;big mystery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f29/1e9/6ae6cd5ad9b98c0bbc068df03e.png><p>How about visiting an&nbsp;island that doesn’t exist? It’s in&nbsp;the South Pacific Ocean between Australia and New Caledonia. It’s called Sandy Island. It&nbsp;was first discovered in&nbsp;1876. Researchers began putting it&nbsp;on&nbsp;maps at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century. But when people arrived at&nbsp;the specified coordinates, they found no&nbsp;island.</p><p>So, by&nbsp;1970, people had removed it&nbsp;from all the maps released at&nbsp;that time. Then in&nbsp;2012, Sandy Island appeared again. This time, on&nbsp;Google Maps. The researchers came there but still found nothing. Maybe it&nbsp;had gone underwater? With the help of&nbsp;echolocation devices, they explored the seabed but didn’t notice any signs of&nbsp;an&nbsp;island.</p><p>They found out that it&nbsp;appeared on&nbsp;the maps because of&nbsp;human error when printed cards were being transferred to&nbsp;digital ones. The mistake was quickly corrected, but a&nbsp;trace of&nbsp;it&nbsp;remained. If&nbsp;you enter these coordinates into Google Maps, you’ll see a&nbsp;mysterious black spot in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the ocean. And that’s precisely where I&nbsp;am narrating this story... Nah.</p><p>But how did people discover it&nbsp;in&nbsp;1876? Most likely, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;underwater volcano that woke up&nbsp;and spewed some magma out. In&nbsp;cold water, it&nbsp;solidified and turned into pumice. So, people on&nbsp;that ship must have noticed huge floating pieces of&nbsp;volcanic rock and mistook them for an&nbsp;island.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7d1/540/662bd85e2ead6daa2cbb813665.png><p>Our next island could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;new continent but turned into nothing. At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century, famous marine explorer Robert Peary, the first in&nbsp;history to&nbsp;reach the North Pole, went on&nbsp;an&nbsp;expedition to&nbsp;the northernmost Canadian island&nbsp;— Ellesmere. He&nbsp;was on&nbsp;the shore, looking through his binoculars at&nbsp;the ocean.</p><p>In&nbsp;the distance, amid the white snow, he&nbsp;noticed the white peaks of&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant island stretched across the horizon. The traveler didn’t have enough food and fuel to&nbsp;get there and check out this land. He&nbsp;wrote the coordinates in&nbsp;his diary and went back to&nbsp;the mainland. Together with other researchers, they concluded that he&nbsp;had found not just an&nbsp;island but a&nbsp;new continent.</p><p>A&nbsp;few years later, Robert Peary organized a&nbsp;new expedition to&nbsp;that place. But this time, he&nbsp;couldn’t find the mysterious icy land. The ship stayed in&nbsp;cold waters for several days, drifting from side to&nbsp;side. The crew was running out of&nbsp;food and fuel. They were about to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back, but then they noticed those snowy peaks again.</p><p>The joy of&nbsp;discovery was quickly replaced by&nbsp;disappointment. Those peaks were just fog. Under the influence of&nbsp;cold air and the sun’s rays, the fog looked like an&nbsp;island at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain angle. When the ship approached&nbsp;it, the island dissolved like a&nbsp;mirage... Oh, well.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmoKykkaOxbrXSZqmorJGptq%2BzjJqlnWWepK%2BwsNhmoqenp6h6qsDSZqSyq6Sav7p5l2praXFkZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nigerian-rapper-maxino-releases-new-ep-rich-and-wacko.html><span>←</span><span>Nigerian Rapper Maxino releases new EP 'Rich &amp;amp; Wacko'</span></a>
