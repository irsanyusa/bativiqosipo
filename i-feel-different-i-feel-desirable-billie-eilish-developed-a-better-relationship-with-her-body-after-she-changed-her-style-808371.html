Her live performances were extremely mind-blowing, but that little detail was kinda hard to&nbsp;miss, especially by&nbsp;her fans. Recently, she showed a&nbsp;different style as&nbsp;she posed for the cover of&nbsp;<i>British Vogue</i>, with a&nbsp;picture that made all of&nbsp;our heads turn.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are proud of&nbsp;Billie Eilish, who was able to&nbsp;speak up&nbsp;about her struggles with style and <a href=# title="body image" data-link=tag>body image</a>. She now has a&nbsp;better relationship with her body, and we&nbsp;admire her for that.</p><p><h2>Young Billie used to&nbsp;worry about the way her body looks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cc/e74/b6804459e3be439931bbf0cca4.jpg><p>Billie Eilish has a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;body dysmorphia, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>according</a> to&nbsp;her, she started to&nbsp;worry about her appearance when she was around 12&nbsp;years old. It&nbsp;all started when she joined a&nbsp;dance company, she soon started to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;toxic relationship with her body.</p><p>She mentioned that dancing was not easy for her because of&nbsp;that, “At&nbsp;dance, you wear really tiny clothes. And I’ve never felt comfortable in&nbsp;really tiny clothes.” It&nbsp;even got worse when she quit dancing after rupturing the growth plate in&nbsp;her hip. The incident triggered mental health issues like depression and accentuated her discomfort with her own body.</p><p><h2>She wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;appreciated for her music, nothing more.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dce/409/b9db685c3b8c92630498ceef8b.jpg><p>Billie’s thoughts about body and all that she’s been through helped her develop a&nbsp;unique style. She chose to&nbsp;wear baggy clothes that would cover her body because only then people would not talk about her body.</p><p>When asked about her style, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;never want the world to&nbsp;know everything about&nbsp;me. That’s why&nbsp;I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an&nbsp;opinion because they haven’t seen what’s underneath.”</p><p><h2>She was rocking her red carpet looks with her unique style.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3fd/c42/700240579f890c4783b1a9f668.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the 2020 Oscar ceremony, she showed up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;white <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chanel</a> suit that covered her whole body. She seemed so&nbsp;happy and confident with what she was wearing, and we&nbsp;can’t blame her, it&nbsp;looked beautiful on&nbsp;her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/42f/032/cddbcb5007900ee5b02b9bee35.jpg><p>She sure knows how to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;entrance, her style is&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;miss, and the details are always on&nbsp;point. Her fans adore her <a href=# title=music data-link=tag>music</a> and her style, after all, she’s the one who makes thousands of&nbsp;people scream with joy during her live performances.</p><p><h2>But she was tired of&nbsp;baggy clothes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fb7/b42/470b925998b56059b4c754df89.jpg><p>Billie was also comfortable with that style because she didn’t want people to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;her because of&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>body</a>, but things were about to&nbsp;change for the Canadian pop star. We&nbsp;first noticed her style change when she wore a&nbsp;beautiful dress to&nbsp;the Met Gala in&nbsp;2021, and she looked gorgeous in&nbsp;it.</p><p>The star even admitted that her outlook has changed lately. She explained that she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>struggled</a> to&nbsp;feel desirable because of&nbsp;that: “Wearing baggy clothes, nobody is&nbsp;attracted to&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;feel incredibly unlovable and unsexy and not beautiful.”</p><p><h2>It’s all about what makes you feel good.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/849/87e/1b6fea523c942984d191011597.jpg><p>Billie’s experience when she was young influenced her behavior toward showing her body in&nbsp;public. But as&nbsp;she’s grown&nbsp;up, she’s changed her way of&nbsp;thinking, and we&nbsp;love her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>statements</a> about&nbsp;it: “Let’s turn it&nbsp;around and be&nbsp;empowered in&nbsp;that. Showing your body and showing your skin&nbsp;— or&nbsp;not&nbsp;— should not take any respect away from you.”</p><p>She posed gracefully in&nbsp;lingerie for <i>British Vogue</i>, a&nbsp;look that made the world see Billie in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different light. She’s proudly showing her skin and her beautiful body, away from the baggy clothes she was known to&nbsp;wear, with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>quote</a> on&nbsp;the cover that says it&nbsp;all: “It’s all about what makes you feel good.”</p><p><h2>She’s embracing her body right now.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/358/a55/92bedf5448b1ff9728ef5d2e63.jpg><p>Now that the pop star is&nbsp;more confident in&nbsp;showing her skin and adopting different styles, she regrets some of&nbsp;the promos she did. She admitted that she doesn’t know who that person was and that it&nbsp;was certainly not her. She believes that she became that vibe because she didn’t have time to&nbsp;think about herself or&nbsp;what would suit her best.</p><p>Besides the fact that she’s more aware of&nbsp;what makes her feel better, she realized that people were going to&nbsp;talk about her style no&nbsp;matter what. It&nbsp;was up&nbsp;to&nbsp;her to&nbsp;choose who she wants to&nbsp;be. “In&nbsp;the past couple of&nbsp;months, I&nbsp;feel far more solid in&nbsp;who I&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;feel different now, like I’m desirable. I&nbsp;feel like I’m capable of&nbsp;being as&nbsp;feminine as&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;and as&nbsp;masculine as&nbsp;I&nbsp;want.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af7/0eb/2aa36a5fa5ac58ef2ade6d20e8.jpg><p>Billie released a&nbsp;powerful <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>statement</a> that will inspire her fans for sure: “I&nbsp;love that my&nbsp;body is&nbsp;mine and that it’s with me&nbsp;everywhere I&nbsp;go. I&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;think of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body as&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend. My&nbsp;ugly friend! It’s complicated. But what are you gonna&nbsp;do?” We&nbsp;love this statement, and we&nbsp;believe that having a&nbsp;good relationship with your body is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;self-love.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you believe that a&nbsp;change of&nbsp;style can boost your self-confidence?
