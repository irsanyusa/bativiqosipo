Foster, recently defended her father against an Instagram user who claimed that the legendary composer abandoned his adult children for his two-year-old son Rennie. He shares his baby boy with wife, Katharine McPhee.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-foster-s-daughter-says-dad-didn-t-abandon-his-adult-kids-for-rennie>David Foster’s Daughter Says Dad Didn’t Abandon His Adult Kids for Rennie</h2><p>The musician’s daughter is making it clear that communication is strong between them and their dad. On Instagram, Foster posted a video of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rennie</a> playing drums to Michael Jackson’s hit “Rock with You.”</p><p>In the comments, many took the time to express their awe in Rennie’s discovered musical talent. However, one particular comment claimed that the singer has disregarded his adult daughters, prompting Amy to speak up.</p><p>“Lol!!!! He’s the dad…..he’s also got daughters (he abandoned) older than me,” the user responded to somebody else.</p><p>“Hi….I’m a daughter…absolutely no abandonment,” Amy wrote. “I literally just talked to my dad five minutes ago. Are you sticking up for us?”</p><p>Foster’s daughter went on and slammed the user for bringing negative energy to the comment section.</p><p>“All you have to do is look at the comments and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rennie’s</a> sisters have all chimed in with compliments….We’re great,” she wrote. “We love our dad. Our dad loves us and we love how our dad is with Rennie.”</p><p>Foster shares five other kids from his previous relationships. Included in his blended family are his daughters, Allison, Amy, Sara, Erin, and Jordan.</p><p>While it was Amy who expressly defended her father, Foster’s other daughters have made it clear that they appreciate their dad’s efforts for them.</p><p>“He was working to provide for us,” Sara <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> People. “As an adult, you realize it’s impossible to be a perfect parent, and you don’t realize that until you have your own kids.”</p><p>As per Jordan, their dad was “there always” as they were growing up. Such presence included imparting them lessons about life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-says-raising-son-at-73-requires-patience>He Says Raising Son at 73 Requires “Patience”</h2><p>Last year, the Grammy-winning producer shared his experience on raising a baby boy. Having raised six adult daughters, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Foster</a> admitted that having a son is “a little bit different.”</p><p>“At this point in my life, it’s different again,” he said. “Not better or worse, just different. I still work, I’m still gone a lot, but maybe the time is a little more precious to me because I got more runway behind me than I have ahead of me now.”</p><p>As he puts more effort now, Foster said “patience” is a requirement as a father of a toddler. This characteristic, he admits, is one he lacked when he was parenting his daughters.</p><p>“I was not patient when I was young,” he said. “I was arrogant and just on the move.”</p><p>In a separate interview, Foster got candid about his regrets in raising his daughters.</p><p>“I missed a lot because I didn’t raise them,” he said. “The geography was really tough. That was my own doing and a regret that I have, but it was what it was and there was no changing it. So I did the best I could, which was quite imperfect at times. Plus, I worked so much. I mean, I’ve made a pound of music in my life.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_JennaJohnson_ValChmerkovskiy_Michael-TullbergGetty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="Jenna Johnson, Val Chmerkovskiy Celebrate Son Rome’s First Birthday: “Sweetest Soul I’ve Ever Known”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdm7y0wMSrqmackaq0qcDEq2SdnZKqu6y%2FjKKlrKyRnL%2BiuYycpqallaPBbrTEZpibmZ6ZvK%2Bxw2ampZyVp3qktMilm6udnmKzsL6Ma2SynZGnerC4w2aqqKZf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./celine-dion-emotional-performance-on-eiffel-tower-olympics-opening-ceremony-16288.html><span>←</span><span>Celine Dion's Emotional Performance at the Olympics</span></a>
