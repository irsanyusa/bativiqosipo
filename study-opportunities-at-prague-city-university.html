This university might have been founded quite recently, in 2004, but it offers a British education style in the heart of Europe and a wide range of British-accredited study programmes in business, art, design and media.</p><p>We already covered some of their programmes in our article on <a title="Study art and design in Czechia" href=#>study options for artists and designers</a> and mentioned that if you want to become a <a title="Study Teaching of English in Czechia" href=#>certified English teacher</a>, PCU has you covered, but their variety is much broader. Moreover, campuses are located in the city centre so you will always be just a few steps away from cosy cafés, restaurants, parks, libraries and art galleries.</p><h3><b>International Management from bachelor to master</b></h3><p>What might particularly get your attention is a three-year-long bachelor programme <strong>International Management</strong> that also offers a follow-up master’s programme so you won’t have to switch schools later. You will learn about negotiation, teamwork, leadership, test your skills on case studies and attend various workshops.</p><p>You will study subjects such as contemporary business, marketing practices, employee management, financial accounting, business project management, accounting, statistics for business decision-making, business law, economics, digital marketing, research methods, global trade, international financial markets and many more.</p><h3><b>For future business experts</b></h3><p>Should you want something that has to do with money, go for a three-year-long <strong>International Finance and Business Accounting</strong> study programme that promises to teach you all you need to know in the field of accounting, finance, business management and entrepreneurship. This study programme is tailored for the 21st century and covers topics such as Fin-Tech systems and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>You’re going to study subjects such as contemporary marketing practices, issues in the contemporary business market, business in Fin-Tech systems, operations & supply chain management, advanced management accounting, financial management, ethical frameworks & international corporate governance and learn about international financial markets.</p><h3><b>A leadership qualification</b></h3><p>If you’ve acquired your master’s degree already, you still feel that you need to get further qualifications but you don’t want to spend as many years studying, there’s a one-year-long MSc study programme called <strong>Leadership and Strategic Management</strong>. This programme is designed for working professionals who wish to obtain a formal qualification in leadership. You will obtain a deep understanding of leadership and the factors that influence employee management and strategic decision-making.</p><h3><b>Explore blended learning</b></h3><p>PCU also offers a unique education opportunity called “blended learning.” Their Global Blended Degree allows students to attend a 3-year-long programme online through the Digital Campus. Lectures aren’t only pre-recorded, though. Students will receive individual tutoring and are expected to actively participate during lectures.</p><p>If you want to study from home, but you still wish to experience Prague, don’t be sad. Two residential weekend sessions in Prague will allow you to visit PCU campuses, meet your classmates and attend workshops. The biggest advantage is that you can start studying in either September, February or even June.
