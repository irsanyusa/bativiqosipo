In a career spanning nine decades and continuing until shortly before his death, he appeared in more than 300 films and was one of the last surviving stars of the silent film era.</p><p class=cnwpara>At the height of a career that was marked by precipitous declines and raging comebacks, Rooney performed the role of Andy Hardy in a series of 15 films in the 1930s and 1940s that epitomized American family values. A versatile performer, he became a celebrated character actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said he considered Rooney "the best there has ever been".</p><p class=cnwpara>Rooney first performed in vaudeville as a child and made his film debut at the age of six. At 14 he played Puck in the play and later the 1935 film adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream. Critic David Thomson hailed his performance as "one of the cinema's most arresting pieces of magic". In 1938, he co-starred in Boys Town.</p><p class=cnwpara>Rooney was the top box-office attraction from 1939 to 1941 and one of the best-paid actors of that era, but his career would never again rise to such heights. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he served nearly two years entertaining over two million troops on stage and radio and was awarded a Bronze Star for performing in combat zones.</p><p class=cnwpara>At his death, Vanity Fair called him "the original Hollywood train wreck". He struggled with alcohol and pill addiction. Ava Gardner was his first wife, and he would go on to marry an additional seven times. Despite earning millions during his career, he had to file for bankruptcy in 1962 due to mismanagement of his finances.</p>Net Worth:<h3>Mickey Rooney Net Worth: $<span id=Total>100 Million</span></h3><b>Mickey Rooney's Income / Salary:</b><br><b>Per Year:</b> $<span id=Year>20 Million</span><p><b>Per Month:</b> $<span id=Month>2 Million</span></p><p><b>Per Week:</b> $<span id=Week>500,000</span></p><table style=width:100%><tbody><tr><td><b>Per Day:</b></td><td><b>Per Hour:</b></td><td><b>Per Minute:</b></td><td><b>Per Second:</b></td></tr><tr><td>$<span id=Day>70,000</span><span></span></td><td>$<span id=Hour>3,000</span></td><td>$<span id=Minute>50</span></td><td>$<span id=Second>1.00</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br>Since you arrived on this page at <span id=CurrentTime></span>, Mickey Rooney Earned: <span id=earnNow></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmwp6KptW%2B6xK1ma2hhbnxxfo6hprBlnaqwqXnMqKWesV2ZvKa%2FjKagnKOVrnqzu86nnLJlnZa4pnrHraSl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cillian-murphy-small-things-like-these-ireland-magdalene-laundries-collective-trauma-1235911927.html><span>←</span><span>Cillian Murphy on Exploring the Collective Trauma of Irelands Magdalene Laundries in</span></a>
