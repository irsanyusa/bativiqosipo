The answer is far from simple. “One of the problems with the net worth is that it’s very, very difficult to calculate,” royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams tells TIME.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The exact net worth of any royal family member is unknown, and estimates from online sources range. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CelebrityNetWorth</a> has pegged the net worth of Prince William, next in line to the throne, at $100 million. However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Daily Express </a>and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">other news outlets</a> reported his worth skyrocketed to more than $1 billion after he took over the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate worth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">£1 billion ($1.3 billion)</a>, from his father, King Charles III, upon the death of his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, in September 2022.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Duchy of Cornwall “funds the public, charitable, and private activities of the Prince of Wales and his family,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to its website. </a>The estate was established by Edward III in 1337 to provide independence to his son and heir, Prince Edward.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The portfolio includes land, farm tenancies, and commercial properties across at least 20 counties in England and Wales. In 2023, the assets created £24 million ($30 million) in “distributable surplus,” according to the estate’s most recent annual report. Royals are not obligated to pay income tax, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">have voluntarily done so</a> since 1993, according to Parliament.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On top of those holdings, Prince William, along with his younger brother Prince Harry, received inheritances from his mother, Princess Diana, and paternal great grandmother, the Queen Mother.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When the Queen Mother died in 2002, she left about £14 million ($17.6 million today) to her great-grandsons, with the bulk going to Prince Harry since William would benefit financially from one day becoming King, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC reported.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following their mother’s death in 1997, the brothers inherited $21.3 million after taxes to share between them, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to her will.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prince William has also previously earned money independently. From 2006 to 2013, he served in the British military, earning between $68,000 and $74,000 in his last position in 2011, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Forbes</a>. After that, he worked for charity East Anglian Air Ambulance, but donated his $62,000 salary to charity, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reader’s Digest reported</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Prince <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">became a full-time working royal </a>in 2017, spending his time in public engagements as a patron to charities and representative for the country and Crown. He gets his official living, travel, and household expenses paid for from what is called the Sovereign Grant.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Each year, the royal family gives profits from its vast holdings under the Crown Estate to the U.K. government, but gets paid back a proportion in the form of the Sovereign Grant. Historically, the proportion was 15%, but that amount was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">raised to 25% </a>in 2017 for 10 years to cover renovations at Buckingham Palace. However, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">government announced it would be cut</a> to 12% starting this year because of new profits from offshore wind farms on the Crown Estate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the most recent financial year, the royal family received £86 million ($109 million) from the Sovereign Grant, according to an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">annual report published in June 2023</a>. That equals out to £1.29 ($1.63) per person in the U.K., according to the royal website. A core grant of £51.8 million ($65 million) funds official travel, property maintenance, and household operating costs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, the Sovereign Grant doesn’t cover Prince William and other royals’ security costs, which is paid for by the taxpayer, with amounts never disclosed, Fitzwilliams says.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prince William shares finances with his wife, Kate Middleton, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Princess of Wales, who is worth an estimated $10 million</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The couple make use of three homes—Kensington Palace in London, Anmer Hall in Norfolk, and Adelaide Cottage on the Windsor Castle estate. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Guardian reported</a> that Anmer Hall was a gift from Queen Elizabeth II, while the couple pays rent on Adelaide Cottage, where they mainly live with their three children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWdphXl8jqmpoqaTmnq4tculoJqlXaOytXnWqKmtoF2awLW1zJqroqeeqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nick-offerman-gumption-parks-rec.html><span>←</span><span>Nick Offerman on New Book &amp;quot;Gumption,&amp;quot; Feminism, and Gay Rights</span></a>
