In a bare, glowing white room, Iris (a supple yet self-possessed Julia Goldani Telles of The Affair) explains to a glamorous older woman that she’s abandoning an elite undergraduate education in the States for a new life in London.

On the night of Sept. 26—a date now inscribed on Mexico’s calendar of historic atrocities—police and cartel thugs in the town of Iguala went on a killing spree. First they shot dead three students and three passersby, slicing the face off one victim and leaving his corpse on a street.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ogun REC slumps, dies after INEC meeting in Abuja</h2><time>Aug 12, 2024</time>
