1. Tom Cruise was offered the lead role, but he&nbsp;turned it&nbsp;down.
Many famous actors were considered for the role of&nbsp;Rick O’Connell, including Tom Cruise, but the actor turned it&nbsp;down and Brendan Fraser was cast instead."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

This made the iconic duo of&nbsp;Rick and Evelyn, played by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Brendan Fraser" data-link=tag>Brendan Fraser</a> and Rachel Weisz, return to&nbsp;the big screen soon after for a&nbsp;sequel, which was also a&nbsp;commercial success.</p><p><h2>1. Tom Cruise was offered the lead role, but he&nbsp;turned it&nbsp;down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89e/f4d/1a7a20547486ce2b8980d098d4.jpg><p>Many famous actors were considered for the role of&nbsp;Rick O’Connell, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, but the actor turned it&nbsp;down and Brendan Fraser was cast instead. Cruise had almost 2&nbsp;decades to&nbsp;change his mind, and he&nbsp;eventually went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;the 2017 reboot of&nbsp;<i>The Mummy.</i></p><p><h2>2. The actor who played Imhotep had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fully shaved twice a&nbsp;day during filming.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff1/2d9/8c23b55c02836f89dbed68417c.jpg><p>Arnold Vosloo’s character required his whole body to&nbsp;be&nbsp;completely hairless while shooting. And even though they first tried waxing, Vosloo didn’t want to&nbsp;repeat the painful experience, so&nbsp;staff members opted for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shaving</a> his body twice a&nbsp;day instead.</p><p><h2>3. Rachel Weisz’s character was named after a&nbsp;real person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/228/7a5/1eda8d50a7ab0c6036682920fd.jpg><p>The character of&nbsp;Evelyn Carnahan was inspired by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Evelyn Herbert</a>, who was the daughter of&nbsp;British Egyptologist George Herbert, 5th Earl of&nbsp;Carnarvon. In&nbsp;1922, the real-life Evelyn and her father were the first 2&nbsp;people in&nbsp;modern times to&nbsp;enter Tutankhamun’s tomb.</p><p><h2>4. The movies were actually filmed in&nbsp;Morocco, not Egypt.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/887/87c/98cc7352e6ac3e2c5da2434387.jpg><p>Although the action of&nbsp;the first 2&nbsp;movies in&nbsp;the trilogy is&nbsp;set in&nbsp;Egypt, due to&nbsp;several issues, cast members couldn’t film there. Instead, they chose Morocco as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>location</a>, and what we&nbsp;see as&nbsp;early twentieth-century Cairo in&nbsp;the movies is&nbsp;actually Marrakech.</p><p><h2>5. The actors on&nbsp;set had to&nbsp;drink a&nbsp;special brew every few hours.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/745/72e/e3b3a75b899dfadc6a42e3067b.jpg><p>Because they were shooting in&nbsp;the desert, the actors faced several real-life dangers, including dehydration. To&nbsp;prevent this, the medical team on&nbsp;set came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>special concoction</a> that the actors had to&nbsp;drink every few hours.</p><p><h2>6. Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez spent several months training just for one scene.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/044/2d3/afbcf7594eb486606da6ed1e8a.jpg><p>Although stunt doubles could have easily been used for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fight scene</a> in&nbsp;<i>The Mummy Returns</i>, both actresses decided to&nbsp;avoid this. Instead, they trained for 3&nbsp;months for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;8&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;shape and be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;shoot the scene themselves.</p><p><h2>7. Real rats and insects were used for some of&nbsp;the scenes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f89/908/b5482e57098e28ca2ecd0da133.jpg><p>The horror we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;Weisz’s face when she’s tied up&nbsp;and has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rats</a> crawl over here is&nbsp;genuine. Real rats were used for the scene, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;other <a href=# title=insects data-link=tag>insects</a> and vermin. The actor who played Dr. Chamberlain also had actual locusts crawl all over his neck and face.</p><p><h2>8. The set was built inside of&nbsp;a&nbsp;volcano.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fba/159/60abe555b8b8510ed58240f6c9.jpg><p>The set for the lost city of&nbsp;Hamunaptra was erected inside of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>volcano</a> in&nbsp;southeast Morocco. Obviously, the <a href=# title=volcano data-link=tag>volcano</a> was a&nbsp;dormant one, and it&nbsp;even had an&nbsp;old fort already built inside&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>9. The scene in&nbsp;the library was filmed in&nbsp;just one take.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f4/318/30d7335c16b51bfff6cb92e110.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the first scenes of&nbsp;the movie, Weisz’s character is&nbsp;putting away books in&nbsp;the library. But the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clumsy librarian</a> causes most of&nbsp;the books to&nbsp;come tumbling down. Putting them all back on&nbsp;the shelves would’ve taken many hours, but thanks to&nbsp;Weisz’s great acting, the scene was filmed in&nbsp;just one single take.</p><p><h2>10. The Medjai were originally supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tattooed head to&nbsp;toe.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fff/119/16b0605446bb2f820a4bf1aec7.jpg><p>Director Stephen Sommers changed his mind because he&nbsp;thought actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oded Fehr </a>was too handsome to&nbsp;be&nbsp;covered in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many tattoos.</p><p><h2>11. The actor who played Beni wasn’t very well-liked by&nbsp;the camels.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/502/670/f75bae5961861bc5992e42d2b7.jpg><p>Beni, played by&nbsp;Kevin J. O’Connor, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very unlikable character in&nbsp;the movie, and even the camels seemed to&nbsp;agree. During the scene where he&nbsp;loads up&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>camels</a>, the animals refuse to&nbsp;move. This, however, wasn’t scripted, but it&nbsp;seems the camels decided to&nbsp;add their own touch to&nbsp;the film.</p><p><h2>12. Brendan Fraser almost died while filming the scene in&nbsp;the gallows.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe1/ad1/e6015d5c918f3df214fa2231d5.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scenes</a>, Rick O’Connell is&nbsp;imprisoned and taken to&nbsp;the gallows to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hanged, while Evelyn tries to&nbsp;negotiate his release and ends up&nbsp;saving his life. Although a&nbsp;stunt double was used for the body shots, Fraser still had to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;rope placed around his neck for close-ups. During the second take, the rope was tightened to&nbsp;make Fraser’s acting more realistic, but the actor actually ended up&nbsp;passing out and had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;revived by&nbsp;the EMTs on&nbsp;set.</p><p>What’s your favorite movie from <i>The Mummy</i> franchise?
