Instead of giving up, Hemsworth revealed a cunning plan to sneak his daughter onto the ride.</p><p>"She was really upset," he said, "And I was like nah, forget this. Come here."</p><p>In order to make up the height difference, Hemsworth went on: "I grabbed a couple of Snicker bars and slammed it in the back of her shoe under the heel."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I walked up [to the Disneyland staff], was like, 'What about now?'</p><p>"And they're like, 'Okay, in you come,'" Hemsworth said to applause from the audience.</p><p>However, Johansson chimed in: "It's wildly irresponsible as well, and you're all cheering."</p><p>Hemsworth and his daughter managed to get on the ride, but the actor soon realised that perhaps the height limits were there for a reason.</p><p>"So, we're sitting in the chair... We're at the top and I'm looking at her and she's strapped in and the seat is massive on her," he said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Hemsworth then described the moment the ride dropped and mimiced his daughter rising out of her seat: "[I] grab onto her, she's like screaming the whole way down.</p><p>"I was like maybe there's a reason there's a height sign."</p><p>At which point in the story, Downey Jr. exclaims: "Maybe!?"</p><p>Hemsworth seems to have learned his lesson, though he finished the story by saying: "So, don't do that. She's fine, she's well. I'm her hero."</p><p><strong>Watch him tell the full story here:</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Fans on Twitter were quick to criticise the actor for potentially endangering his daughter.</p><p>"Putting things in your daughter's shoes so she can go on a Disney ride??? Really??? Those rules are there to protect your child! #ParentFail," <a href=# id=18b780ae-e473-395c-a6c3-4a167d4a7546>wrote one person</a> .</p><p>But the actor also received some support from fans who thought his commitment to getting his daughter on the ride was adorable.</p><p>"Chris Hemsworth putting snicker bars in his daughter's shoe so she was tall enough to ride tower of terror is the funniest dad story I've ever heard," <a href=# id=3ab64291-da59-33a8-a071-1655d9f71c95>wrote one</a> .</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"You cant tell me that Chris Hemsworth sticking snickers into his daughter's shoes so she would be tall enough for a rollercoaster ride isnt EXACTLY what Thor would do for his kid," <a href=# id=53a2262a-0046-3b7a-abc8-59a0a5d5f432>tweeted another</a> .</p><p><strong><span id=39b8e3ab-b467-3d4c-a726-e61b8ef0e99b>You can read all of INSIDER's "Avengers: Endgame" coverage here.</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7y6Kdnqukrrmme8KhqaKrXZ2yrr%2FWqKmtoF2owbayxZ6bZquenrCssdGsZJuZoqh6qrqMrZ%2BeZZiasq2%2FjKidZqCZqHqlrdSgn62doqh6tLTOnqpmq59iwKmxjLCYrGeanMZ3tsOz</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-all-terrain-tire.html><span>←</span><span>9 Best All-Terrain Tires of 2024</span></a>
