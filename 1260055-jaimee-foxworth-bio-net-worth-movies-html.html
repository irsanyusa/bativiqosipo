She started using alcohol to cope with the stress of being a child in the public eye and the financial struggles that her family was experiencing. When she was 19 years old, she featured in an adult film. This was after her boyfriend pressured her to join the adult film industry because the pay was better compared to the typical photo-shoots she had been doing before.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1255618cdc519ba0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about Rumer Willis bio: who is Bruce Willis and Demi Moore’s daughter?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9ad80c612f71a5fc.jpg><p class=align-left>To cope with the shame of featuring in an adult film, Jaimee started mixing alcohol with painkillers. She starred in more adult films using a pseudonym, but people still recognised her. After her videos surfaced all over the media, she stopped doing adult films.
