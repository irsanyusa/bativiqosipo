If&nbsp;you are asked who the smartest person of&nbsp;modern time is&nbsp;you would probably say Elon Musk or&nbsp;Steve Jobs. But it’s actually someone else who officially has the highest IQ. Her name is&nbsp;Marilyn vos Savant and her brain is&nbsp;her claim-to-fame.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side always feel excited to&nbsp;learn about the lives of&nbsp;outstanding people and today we&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;share the story of&nbsp;Marilyn vos Savant. There is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;bonus for you with the&nbsp;IQ scores of&nbsp;popular personalities.

In a post shared via his Snapchat page on Thursday, May 14, 2020, the music star laughed off the insinuation that he is worth $3.5M which when converted to naira is approximately N1.3B. "They said I'm worth $3.5mill...That won't even buy my cars. I might have to start doing some showing off. Nah. That's not me.

As the CEO of a Silicon Valley start-up and the parent—and coach and cheerleader and chauffeur—of three small kids, I struggle to carve out time for learning new things. A bit ironic since the company I founded (Curious.com) is dedicated to helping busy people learn all kinds of things, from JavaScript to Japanese to jump roping.
But starting Curious has taught me how to build a daily learning regimen. Here are a few of the tricks I’ve picked up that can help you create your own learning routine.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Seyi Vibez's 'NAHAMciaga' is most streamed project in Nigerian in H1 2024</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>

9. 11. 2021 | Student Ambassadors How did you find out about the Czech Republic?
I just was reading about universities and programs in different countries, to find out my best choice. While on the European continent I found that the Czech Republic offers a great multicultural study experience, bringing together cultures from all over the world. Students appreciate the beautiful, developed cities and the great variety of social life available.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>The iconic 'I amsterdam' sign has been removed for being 'too individualistic'</h2><time>Jun 3, 2024</time>

However, tourists keen to get a selfie with the sign may be disappointed — the letters outside the Rijksmuseum in Museum Square have been removed. The sign was apparently deconstructed because the square was becoming overcrowded, and due to fear that it's become a symbol of "mindless mass tourism" and is "too individualistic." The woman behind the removal is city councillor and Amsterdam leader of the left wing GroenLinks party, Femke Roosma.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Best Indoor Bike Trainers of 2024</h2><time>Jun 2, 2024</time>

While it’s always preferable to perform your training rides outside, your location, in addition to factors like weather and daylight, don’t always allow for that.

After Chloe Kim returned home from the 2018 Olympics in South Korea, she put her gold medal in what felt at the time like the right place: a trash bin at her parents’ house.
“I hated life,” Kim, now 21, recalls over plates of pad thai in the airy four-bedroom home in the west side of Los Angeles she shares with her boyfriend, skateboarder Evan Berle.
