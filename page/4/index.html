For a while there, it looked as if this could be a summer with nary a craze in sight. But not for long. Suddenly this has become the summer of the Velcro paddle and ball.
The idea for the new toy is simple: put stick-to-itself Velcro on a sphere that is roughly the size of a tennis ball. Apply the same stuff to two mitt- size disks that have a strap across the back for a handhold.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>TIME Magazine Cover: Race for the Moon - Dec. 6, 1968 - NASA - Space Exploration - Moon - Russia</h2><time>Sep 12, 2024</time>

Just like society in&nbsp;general, cinematography has been changing over the years, broadening its horizons and breaking stereotypes. The roles that used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;written for men only, can now be&nbsp;played by&nbsp;the representatives of&nbsp;both genders. Wild West conquerors, soldiers, bankers, and even war robots&nbsp;— these and many other images have already lost their gender inclinations. However, there are still many hot debates about which gender does better in&nbsp;certain roles.
