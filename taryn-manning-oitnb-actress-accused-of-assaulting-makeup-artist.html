A judge declined to grant Hartman the restraining order, citing that she filed it in Los Angeles, when the alleged incident took place in New York.</p><p>Manning's attorney tells <strong>People magazine</strong> that the OITNB star, 37, has not had any recent contact with the makeup artist. The pair have a long history together, with Manning arrested in 2012 for allegedly assaulting Hartman. Those charges were later dropped, and at the time they were described as longtime friends.</p><p>"The court has already denied the request by Ms. Hartman for a temporary restraining order. The application for the order is suspect because Ms. Manning has had no contact with Ms. Hartman in many months due to Ms. Hartman's actions against Ms. Manning which are currently under criminal investigation in multiple jurisdictions," Hartman's legal counsel tells PEOPLE in a statement.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"These investigations have long predated these entirely fabricated allegations. Ms. Hartman is under investigation for stalking Ms. Manning and for theft and other crimes. It is clear that Ms. Hartman's camp has leaked these allegations which were not available publicly to elevate her own position and obscure her own wrong doing."</p><p>In her restraining order, Hartman reportedly claims Manning yelled, "I'm wearing a white shirt there will be a lot of blood. You will be famous for killing Taryn Manning."</p><p>Manning, who plays Tiffany Doggett on OITNB, also starred in Hustle and Flow, 8 Mile and Crazy/Beautiful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGatmaKuu265wKeloqaXYryqwM2bZJqbpKeytL%2BMmpqcraOasW67xWaYrKuRqrm1tc2gZKaZm5rCsXnAq6uiq6Rks3S5mKCusA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./british-monarchy-approval-king-charles-queen-elizabeth.html><span>←</span><span>With Charles on the Throne, Many Younger Britons Say Its Time to Move On From the Monarchy</span></a>
