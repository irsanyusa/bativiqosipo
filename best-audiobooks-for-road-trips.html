The 26 <a href=#>best audiobooks</a> for road trips as selected by TIME include a deep dive into <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a>’s songwriting, a celebrated <a href=#>Ann Patchett</a> novel, and a collection of <a href=#>Agatha Christie’s greatest mysteries</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Those looking to upgrade their travel playlists can revisit a childhood classic narrated by Anne Hathaway or enter <a href=#>Sarah J. Maas</a>’s multiverse of romantasy. Catch up on recent notable releases from <a href=#>Silvia Moreno-Garcia</a>, <a href=#>Hanya Yanagihara</a>, and <a href=#>George Saunders</a>. Let rockstar astrophysicist <a href=#>Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> expand your mind or spend nearly 50 hours learning about <a href=#>Barbra Streisand</a>’s life and career from the funny lady herself. (For reference, Google Maps says it takes 41 hours to drive from New York City to Los Angeles.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So whether your destination is somewhere near or very, very far, here are the best audiobooks to listen to when you’re stuck in the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>For day trips (3-8 hours)</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</a>, Neil deGrasse Tyson</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Let Neil deGrasse Tyson, the world famous astrophysicist, teach you about the cosmos with his 2017 book, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry. In just under four hours, Tyson, who narrates the audiobook edition, looks to simplify the most complicated space science concepts like black holes, dark matter, quarks, and everything else in between. By the time you make it to your not-so-far destination, you might have a new appreciation for the universe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>3 hours, 41 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>, L. Frank Baum</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Whether you’re off to see the wizard or someone a little less magical, the 2012 audiobook of L. Frank Baum’s 1900 classic <a href=#>The Wonderful World of Oz</a>, narrated byAnne Hathaway, will help guide you on your way. Hathaway offers a bit of dramatic flair with her narration, changing her voice to become each of the characters from the beloved classic, adding new life to a novel that has delighted kids and adults for more than a century.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>3 hours, 49 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics</a>, Dolly Parton</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hit the road with <a href=#>Dolly Parton </a>and her 2020 audiobook exclusive memoir, Songteller, in which she shares the stories behind 100 of her most popular tracks. (She’s written about 3,000 in her career so amazingly this five hour project is just a fraction of her discography.) Parton treats this audiobook like her diary, spilling the tea on the real-life inspiration for <a href=#>“Jolene”</a> and how “I Will Always Love You” was almost a duet with Elvis, making this a must-listen for even the biggest Dolly disciples.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>5 hours, 18 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Woman In Me</a>, Britney Spears</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Come for Britney Spears finally getting the chance to share her <a href=#>truth about her life</a>, career, and <a href=#>conservatorship</a> in her best-selling memoir <a href=#>The Woman In Me</a>. Stay for the delivery by book narrator, Oscar-nominated actress Michelle Williams, of the incomparable phrase “fo-shizz, fo-shizz.” Seriously, give her all the awards for this.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>5 hours, 31 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</a>, Douglas Adams&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">British comedian <a href=#>Stephen Fry</a> plays it hilariously straight for the 2005 audiobook edition of Douglas Adams’ 1979 sci-fi satire The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. The building of an Earth-destroying intergalactic highway leads Arthur Dent on a journey through space with his friend and writer of the titular interstellar travel guide. This cosmic comedy of traveling errors might just come in handy while on the road.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length:</strong> 5 hours and 51 minutes</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/seth-rogen-stephen-colbert.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Yearbook</a>, Seth Rogen&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you ever wanted to hang out with actor and comedian Seth Rogen, the audio edition of Yearbook, his 2021 memoir in essays, is your chance. Rogen narrates humorous stories about his life including his stand-up debut at 12-years old, the international controversy surrounding his 2014 movie, <a href=#>The Interview,</a> and a rather uncomfortable meeting with George Lucas. Yearbook feels more like a radio drama with 82 of his friends—Nick Kroll, Jason Alexander, Snoop Dogg, Dan Aykroyd, and <a href=#>David Krumholtz</a>, to name a few—using their unique voices to make the funniest stories of Rogen’s life even funnier.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>6 hours, 13 minutes&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Lincoln in the Bardo</a>, George Saunders&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">George Saunders has a reputation as a master of short stories, so when his first full-length novel, Lincoln in the Bardo, came out in 2017, it was a big deal. (It won the Man Booker Prize that year, <a href=#>rather controversially</a>.) So it’s only fitting that the best-selling novel, which tells the story of Abraham Lincoln mourning the death of his young son in an evocative meditation on grief, got <a href=#>a supersized audiobook edition</a> that features 166 different narrators including Nick Offerman, <a href=#>David Sedaris</a>, Ben Stiller, Julianne Moore, Rainn Wilson, and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy. A unique listening experience deserving of being named the <a href=#>2018 Audie Award for Audiobook of the Year</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>7 hours, 25 minutes&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>For longer excursions (8-11 hours)</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Lafayette in the Somewhat United States</a>, Sarah Vowell</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For humorous history buffs and <a href=#>Hamilton fans</a> alike, historian and voice actor Sarah Vowell’s Lafayette in the Somewhat United States is a thoroughly amusing biography of French nobleman and Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette. The audiobook is a fun history lesson narrated by some very funny people playing notable historical figures. Nick Offerman is George Washington, Patton Oswalt is Thomas Jefferson, John Hodgman is John Adams, and John Slattery is Lafayette, complete with a fairly good French accent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length</strong>: 8 hours, 7 minutes</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/john-waters-01.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Carsick: John Waters Hitchhikes Across America</a>, John Waters&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Criss-cross the country with the <a href=#>Pope of Trash</a> himself, John Waters. With 2014’s Carsick, the pencil thin, mustachioed cult-movie director offers his unique perspective on America as he bums rides from unsuspecting road warriors: an octogenarian farmer, a touring indie band, and a Corvette-driving Republican. It’s a wild, weird, and witty trip that may change the way you see the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length</strong>: 8 hours, 8 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>The Dutch House</a>, Ann Patchett&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The audiobook of Ann Patchett’s novel, The Dutch House, allows Tom Hanks, a.k.a. the <a href=#>nicest guy in Hollywood</a>, to play against type. As the narrator of the best-seller—named one of <a href=#>TIME’s Must-Read Books of 2019</a>—Hanks plays Danny, the downtrodden son of Cyril Conroy, a wealthy real estate mogul whose family’s lives begins to unravel after he buys the titular luxurious home in the suburbs of Philadelphia. But this book, written from Danny’s point of view, is not about Cyril or Danny. It’s about Maeve, Danny’s over-protective sister who may be the only one who can put the family back together. Let this American nightmare become the dream listening experience for your next long car ride.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>9 hours, 53 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Mexican Gothic</a>, Silvia Moreno-Garcia</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s best-selling 2020 novel, <a href=#>Mexican Gothic</a>, narrated by actor Frankie Corzo,is a spooky thriller set in 1950s Mexico. Socialite Noemí Taboada finds herself traveling to the Mexican countryside to check on her newlywed cousin, Catalina, who believes her aristocratic husband is slowly poisoning her. Catalina also believes there are ghosts living in the walls of her crumbling English manor. The truth might be even more frightening in this chiller that will have you gripping the steering wheel for dear life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>10 hours, 39 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Blood in the Garden: The Flagrant History of the 1990s New York Knicks</a>, Chris Herring</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you believe ball is life, you’ll love the audiobook version of sportswriter Chris Herring’s Blood in the Garden. The 2022 sports book, read by actor Brian Hutchison, looks back at the trials, tribulations, and all-too-brief triumphs of the intimidating and extremely physical ‘90s Knicks led by Patrick Ewing, John Starks, and coach Pat Riley. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll find yourself chanting “<a href=#>go New York, go New York go</a>” with the windows rolled all the way down.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length:</strong> 11 hours, 3 minutes&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock</a>, Jenny Odell</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For those who have trouble relaxing even when they’re on vacation, <a href=#>Jenny Odell</a>’s Saving Time is the audiobook for you. Four years after the release of her Barack Obama-approved book, <a href=#>How to Do Nothing</a>, Odell returned with a thoughtful exploration of time and how we can learn to use ours more wisely. This isn’t a self-help book; she does not offer tips on how to be more efficient. Instead, Saving Time, narrated by theater actor Kristen Sieh, is a hopeful meditation on learning to live life to the fullest without being totally beholden to the clock.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>11 hours, 27 minutes&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>The Monsters We Defy</a>, Leslye Penelope</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Leslye Penelope</a>’s 2022 novel, The Monsters We Defy, the winner of the <a href=#>2023 Audie Award for Fantasy</a>, is a magical romance set in Washington D.C. during the Jazz Age, read by award-winning audiobook narrator Shayna Small. Clara Johnson, the heroine of Penelope’s bewitching novel, can talk to spirits, an ability that she soon discovers is more a curse than a blessing. When one of those powerful entities offers her a chance to be free of the voices in exchange for stealing a mystical ring from the wealthiest woman in the nation’s capital, she takes it—and the consequences that come with it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>11 hours, 30 minutes</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>For a very long trek (12 - 23 hours)</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/beastie-boys-charles-street.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Beastie Boys Book</a>, Michael “Mike D” Diamond and Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">2018’s Beastie Boys Book is a music memoir that is as unique as the band itself. For the audiobook, the two remaining members of the <a href=#>iconic rap trio</a>, Michael “Mike D” Diamond and Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz, put together the ultimate mixtape with help from 40 of their closest friends—John C. Reilly, <a href=#>Chloë Sevigny</a>, Bette Midler, Amy Poehler, and Rosie Perez, amongst others. This cast of delightful narrators help tell the stories behind the Beastie Boys’ early days, acclaimed career, and friendship, which allows them to lovingly reminisce about their late member and friend <a href=#>Adam “MCA” Yauch</a>, who died in 2012 of cancer.

The dry, humorless (in a good way) narration by Lost actor Francois Chau only adds to the suspense of the novel that offers <a href=#>nuance to the divisive conflict</a>, bringing the protagonist’s competing allegiances and the danger that brings him into full view. Whether you’ve already read the novel or watched <a href=#>the HBO series</a>, listening to The Sympathizer can only deepen your appreciation of the source material.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>13 hours, 53 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>A Court of Thorns and Roses</a>,Sarah J.

Miles’ charming, yet dastardly narration makes Cromwell an anti-hero worth rooting for no matter how hard you try not to. And if you like what you hear, Miles also narrates audiobooks for the other novels in the Wolf Hall trilogy: <a href=#>Bring Up the Bodies</a> and <a href=#>The Mirror and the Light</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Length: </strong>25 hours, 12 minutes</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>A Brief History of Seven Killings</a>, Marlon James</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Marlon James</a>’ <a href=#>Man Booker Prize-winning</a> 2014 novel, A Brief History of Seven Killings, is a fictional account of the violent 1976 break-in at <a href=#>Bob Marley</a>’s Jamaica home that nearly killed the singer, his wife, and his manager.
