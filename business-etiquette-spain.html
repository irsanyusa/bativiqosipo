<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>A short guide to business etiquette in Spain- Lingoda</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Understanding business etiquette in Spain can prevent a social or cultural faux pas. Doing business in another country can be challenging due to the language barrier alone. The Spanish culture and lifestyle can also take some getting used to. Unwritten everyday etiquette rules often carry over into the Spanish workplace culture. Kisses on the cheek? Respecting siestas (afternoon nap breaks)? Will your Spanish colleagues arrive late for a meeting?&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of unique and potentially confusing do’s and don’ts in Spain’s business culture. Not observing proper business meeting etiquette in Spain might simply result in some light embarrassment, but a more serious misstep could cost you a lucrative business deal. So, before you go kissing a Spanish CEO, here are the crucial things you need to know about business etiquette in Spain.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Spanish-business-culture>Spanish business culture</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Let’s break down some of the features that will notably differ in a Spanish business environment.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Structure and leadership</h3><p>According to a cultural comparison tool called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions</a>, Spain scores much higher (57) on the power-distance dimension than the United States (40). This means that Spain’s business culture is generally more structured and hierarchical than that of the United States. Decisions will most likely be made at the highest levels, even if negotiations are conducted by lower-level management.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the lines between the various degrees of management are quite well-defined in Spain. What does this mean for you? If you come from the US, you may be more familiar with Silicon Valley startup culture, in which group dynamics can be fluid and titles don’t always signal a clear power hierarchy. You might find the decision-making process in Spain to be more consolidated and clearly demarcated than you’re accustomed to.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Punctuality</h3><p>According to business etiquette in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spain</a>, it is common and acceptable to arrive late. Most people in Spain endeavor to arrive on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">time</a> for a business meeting, but you might still find yourself waiting for a colleague to show up. Our suggestion is to act accordingly:</p><ul><li>20 minutes late = acceptable without prior notice</li><li>30 minutes late = a call to inform waiting colleagues is respectful</li><li>45+ minutes late = consider rescheduling</li></ul><p>Take estimates for arrival times with a grain of salt. If someone says, “I’ll arrive in five minutes,” expect to wait 15 or 20 minutes. Along the same lines, a colleague who is supposedly walking in “right now” could be as far as five to ten minutes away.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The art of conversation</h3><p>Spanish people are known to talk quite loudly, which may explain why Madrid was recently ranked the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth noisiest city</a> in Europe. According to the business culture in Spain, if your Spanish colleagues are speaking in an elevated voice, they’re not necessarily angry. More likely, it’s just a cultural thing.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Normal topics</a> to discuss in a business context include family, travel, sports, weather and regional customs. It’s best to avoid touchier topics such as terrorism, immigration, bullfighting and comparing Spanish regions (Madrid vs. Barcelona, etc.). These issues tend to be highly politicized in Spain.</p><p>Honesty and trust are also paramount in Spanish professional settings. Building strong interpersonal relationships and “shooting the breeze” with colleagues can be important parts of success in business.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Body language</h3><p>If Spaniards are emphatic in the volume of their speech, they are equally animated in their body language. They may use a variety of hand gestures when speaking. Close contact, such as touching your arm or shoulder during conversation, may occur. Those from the US tend to have a much larger personal space bubble, so try your best not to recoil or show discomfort if you deem the touch appropriate.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Dress code</h3><p>Dress code will depend on the company or sector. Young startups typically adopt a casual attitude towards dress, much like in the US.</p><p>With that said, Spain’s business etiquette does place a high value on appearances. Particularly strict are the traditional sectors, such as the government or law firms in large cities. Here, it’s advisable to wear business formal attire including suits, ties, dresses and dress shoes. No sneakers allowed.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Business-meeting-etiquette-in-Spain>Business meeting etiquette in Spain</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Greetings</h3><p>What does Spanish business etiquette recommend when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">greeting</a> a colleague?</p><p>About <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">64%</a> of Spanish people typically give two kisses (one on each cheek — but only on the cheek) as a standard greeting in work meetings. This is cultural, but it also has to do with unequal gender roles in the workplace. In fact, the exchanges typically change based on the gender(s) of those involved:</p><ul><li>Man to man = handshake</li><li>Man to woman = two kisses</li><li>Woman to woman = handshake</li></ul><p>Some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">12%</a> of Spanish workers in 2019 said that nowadays they feel “uncomfortable” using a kiss to greet coworkers. Imagine how COVID has affected these practices!&nbsp;</p><p>With increasing globalization and new markets opening all the time, business meeting etiquette in Spain is becoming more flexible. Adhering to Spanish-only traditions is not necessary. Spaniards know full well that it’s inappropriate to force a Japanese executive into a cheek kiss or to grab a coworker and smooch them on the mouth.</p><p>To be safe, especially as a foreigner in Spain, it’s best to stick your hand out for a handshake. This is normal and expected behavior for international business dealings.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Names and titles</h3><p>In Spain, everyone has two surnames. The first surname is the father’s, while the second is the mother’s. For example: Alejandra Rodriguez Ulloa. Alejandra is her first name, Rodriguez is her father’s last name and Ulloa is her mother’s last name. Use both surnames, unless instructed to drop one.</p><p>Plenty of Spaniards also have two first names. Colleagues named Juan Carlos and Maria Fernanda will typically use both names in spoken and written communications. Do not make the mistake of applying US or northern European norms by assuming the second name is a middle name that can be left out.</p><p>As for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">respectful titles</a>, you might see señor (mister) or señorita (miss) — or don (sir) or doña (madam) — used together with the last name in written communications. We assure you that it’s common to use just first names without titles in face-to-face conversation, especially among those in equivalent positions.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Business meals</h3><p>Business lunches and dinners are quite common in Spain. Expect a lengthy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sobremesa</a>. Sobremesa (table talk) refers to the chat that happens after the meal is over. Skipping or rushing the sobremesa would be considered rude. It will also be expected for the person or company who invited or coordinated the meeting to cover the entire bill for the table.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-siesta:-fact-or-fiction?>The siesta: fact or fiction?</h2><p>Contrary to what you might expect, most Spanish people do not take a siesta (nap) in the middle of the day. A study found that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">60%</a> of Spanish people have never taken a siesta in their life! Instead of napping, they’re probably just on lunch break.</p><p>Typical work hours in Spain are the same as in most big cities — about 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Lunch may be a bit later than some people are used to, however. Lunch starts around 2 p.m. and typically lasts one or two hours. Since some people choose to go home for lunch, the siesta break is still observed, even if no sleeping is involved.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Don’t sleep on business etiquette in Spain</h2><p>Now you know that business etiquette in Spain does not include the stereotypical siesta, except perhaps as a midday break. It’s also important to know how to greet someone, how to introduce yourself and what topics to avoid during business meetings in Spain. Spanish people tend to be emphatic in their speaking and gestures, and they may make light physical contact during conversation. Don’t let these cultural behaviors startle you or distract you from closing any deals.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/alison-2-3.jpg><h2>Alison Maciejewski Cortez</h2><p>Alison Maciejewski Cortez is Chilean-American, born and raised in California.
