The talented 29-year-old turned all four coaches’ chairs with his cover of “You Found Me” by The Fray.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bodie-turns-four-chairs-in-the-voice-early-release>Bodie Turns Four Chairs in The Voice Early Release</h2><p>Bodie played guitar and showed off amazing emotion on his cover of the 2008 rock song. Blake Shelton was the first coach to push his button and turn, quickly followed by John Legend. Shelton got mad at Legend for it, even standing up and shouting while Bodie continued to sing.</p><p>Eventually, Gwen Stefani turned around as well, causing Shelton to put his head in his hands. The last coach to turn was Camila Cabello. At that point, even Shelton was encouraging her to push her button. Bodie finished his audition with all four coaches facing him.</p><p>“That’s a really good voice!” Stefani said when the performance was over. When Bodie shared that he’s from California, Cabello told him, “You’re so cool. You look like a Californian. You just got that vibe about you.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ALL OF THE SEASON 22 ‘THE VOICE’ COACH GIFTS RANKED</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-which-coach-will-bodie-choose>Which Coach Will Bodie Choose?</h2><p>The coaches wasted no time arguing over whose team Bodie should join. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cabello joked</a> that Shelton is “having, like, a really, really bad run this season.” Legend chimed in to say that “he’s got the runs this season.”</p><p>Shelton bragged that he was the first person to hit his button. He added that he was glad there seems to be so many “rock-sounding artists” auditioning this season. Shelton also waved to Bodie’s wife and son backstage, saying, “Tell him to pick me.”</p><p>Stefani called Bodie’s tone “rare,” saying she wants to “give back” to an artist like him by being his coach. Legend praised his “vocal presence” and the soulful spin he put on the song.</p><p>We’ll find out which coach’s team Bodie chooses to join when The Voice Season 22 returns Monday night at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BritneySpears_EltonJohn_OnStage.jpg alt="Elton John, Britney Spears’ “Hold Me Closer” is a Vibrantly Emotional Must-Watch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKloJ2iYq%2BwsMieZK2toqPAbrLOrqlmm5iWtrO%2FjKKlZqyYmnq3u8icnGadkae5unnRnqOemaOaeqLBw6KroqeeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quelles-sont-les-conditions-de-mise-disposition-des-salles-communales.html><span>←</span><span>Quelles sont les conditions de mise disposition des salles communales ?</span></a>
